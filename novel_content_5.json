At this moment, Qin Ye was seated in the coffin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The surrounding \"mourners\" weren't surprised or horrified by the sudden reanimation of the corpse in the slightest, and one of them even accidentally burped as he had stopped his fake crying too abruptly. \"Is there something wrong, Mr. Qin?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hearse was on the way to Yuncheng from Zhaozhou Province.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the method that Qin Ye had devised. He was using the origin runes of emotions and desires to conceal his emotions and desires, then travel to Yuncheng in a hearse. The drivers and \"mourners\" were all personnel from the Special Investigations Department, and he had examined them using the origin runes of emotions and desires to ensure that they hadn't been possessed by the inner demon in the past.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye offered no reply to the question. Instead, his brows furrowed slightly as he continued to look up at the sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What immense power... This is true energy! The group is led by an advanced Infernal Judge, and there are 10 Anitya Hellguards as well. They're humans, but they possess something that can even pose a threat to a Yama-King!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a shadow flashed through the sky. It was traveling so quickly that it generated a fierce gale, flattening all of the grass in its wake, and even the clouds in the sky were disrupted by the flying figure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's brows furrowed tightly upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a Taoist priest with a long beard, holding a horsetail whisk.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was wearing a blue robe, upon which was inscribed the pattern of a Yin Yang, and his robes were flapping incessantly around him, giving him an ethereal appearance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that this was no ordinary person, and he was the one carrying the thing that Qin Ye sensed could pose a threat to a Yama-King.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as the middle-aged Taoist priest flew past, 10 figures followed along closely behind him like a squad of fighter aircrafts, generating such fierce wind that all of the clouds in their wake were rapidly parting.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They made no attempt to disguise their killing intent whatsoever as they flew directly toward Yuncheng.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Damn it!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye cursed internally as he withdrew his gaze, then laid back down into the coffin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't know what the mortal realm was doing, and he didn't have the time to check. All he could do was place his full trust in them and do everything in his own power from his end.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These types of perilous situations were ones that all rulers hated the most. There was no way to have complete control, and this was an example of the unforeseen circumstances that could arise.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the voice of an investigator suddenly rang out in the earpiece that Qin Ye was wearing. \"We've clarified the situation, Mr. Qin. Half an hour ago, Taoist Master Zhang of Mount Longhu took the Heavenly Teacher Seal and traveled to Yuncheng with all 10 of the Zhengyi Dao's elders.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why have they done that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We're not sure,\" the voice in the earpiece replied.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, the hearse drew to a very abrupt halt amid a flurry of cries of surprise. Two seconds later, the voice in the earpiece rang out again. \"Mr. Qin, the road up ahead has been sealed off.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes narrowed slightly upon hearing this, and right as he was about to lift the coffin lid again to take a look, he suddenly fell completely still, closing his eyes as he laid motionless in the coffin like a true corpse.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right in this instant, all sound seemed to have faded from the world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The investigator who was communicating with him fell silent, and even the sounds of the wind outside and the hearse's running engine had completely vanished. An extremely eerie and oppressive silence had suddenly descended upon the hearse.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint sound rang out, but it didn't inspire any hope or evoke any relief. Instead, it was like walking through a pitch-black alleyway at night with no one else around, only for the sound of another voice to suddenly ring out!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye knew that he and the investigators were the only people in the hearse, so if anyone had entered the vehicle, then the investigators would've definitely alerted him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, they hadn't done that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In fact, he couldn’t even hear the breathing of the investigators. It was as if all of them had been suddenly muted somehow!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of icy Yin energy permeated throughout the entire hearse, immediately following which the sound of heavy panting rang out, alongside the sound of a cane tapping itself against the ground. It sounded as if there were an elderly man walking through the hearse in a labored manner with his feet dragging behind him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the nauseating stench of a corpse spread through the entire vehicle.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Something had just walked into the hearse.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, it was an Abyssal Prefect, so none of the investigators had been able to detect it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An Abyssal Prefect won't be able to blow my cover...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes were tightly shut, and his mind was already racing rapidly. The first thing that he thought of was that this had confirmed his suspicions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As expected, as the Yin Yang Mezzanines continued to close, the inner demon was becoming more and more cautious. Was it waiting? Was it waiting to see if more darkfeathers would appear in order to verify whether it had been tracked down or not? It seemed that despite the caution that Hell had exercised, the darkfeathers that had been sent after the inner demon had still made it quite wary...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps for anyone else, it wouldn't be important to verify this, but that didn't apply to the inner demon as a good portion of its power stemmed from its untraceable nature.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With the Harken's spatial seal posing as a potent threat, any possibility that it had been tracked down could put it in lethal danger!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the darkness, a faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Despite the inner demon's wiles and caution, there was no way that it would've guessed that it wasn't Hell that was targeting it on this occasion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a sharp screeching sound rang out from the coffin lid, following which Yin energy and that same nauseating corpse odor flooded into the coffin. Even with his eyes closed, Qin Ye could sense the change in light, and the disgusting smell almost made him vomit on the spot.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The intruder had opened his coffin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Tsk tsk, it's such a pity that he's died so young. Even his soul has already dissipated.\" A quiet voice rang out above Qin Ye, and a pair of icy hands gently stroked his face. He could even feel the intruder's sharp fingernails tracing over his cheeks.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The fingernails traced all the way down to his chest, then rested over his heart momentarily before abruptly piercing into his body!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of licking and sucking rang out as the intruder devoured the blood on its fingers, and several seconds later, a forlorn sigh rang out. \"So it really is a corpse... How boring...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of the tapping cane gradually faded into the distance, and the world seemed to have been reawakened as all sound returned. Inside the coffin, Qin Ye opened his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a Yama-King, physical death couldn't count as death unless his soul was also destroyed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He counted down the passing time internally, and 10 minutes later, he gently pushed the coffin lid aside before sitting up in the coffin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hearse was still stuck at the same place with cars all around them, and the voices of disgruntled drivers could be heard ringing out incessantly. All of the investigators in the hearse were observing their surroundings with cautious expressions, completely oblivious to the fact that they had just brushed shoulders with death no more than 10 minutes ago.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye hadn't tried to alert them to what was happening as the massive disparity in power between them and the intruder would've rendered his cautionary words futile anyway.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What he really wanted to know was who exactly was that intruder just now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't one of the 73 immortals. There were only several Abyssal Prefects among the 73 immortals, and he had already committed their Yin energy to memory, but that Abyssal Prefect was one that he had never met before.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, the intruder's Yin energy was very strange. It was filled with an aura of rot and decay, as if it had been buried underground for thousands of years. It was as if he had just been visited by a mummy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was feeling very fortunate that he had chosen this course of action now. Given how cautious the inner demon was, there had to be powerful beings stationed beside all of the Yin Yang Mezzanines in the city.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What he had failed to anticipate was that the inner demon had also set up a backup plan even here in the mortal realm. However, there was no way that it would've been able to predict that King Yanluo would be here in person instead of more darkfeathers!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So they've sealed off the road, eh?\" He looked on ahead with tightly gritted teeth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The rats that the inner demon had planted in the government were making their presence felt...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A stockade had already been erected right in front of them, but there was no one behind the stockade!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the people wearing police uniforms and high visibility vests were living corpses!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Damn it...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye cursed internally as he glanced at his own watch, then laid back down into the coffin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were still 11 hours left.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Given these precautionary measures, either something big was about to happen or the inner demon was already preparing to retreat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he couldn't enter Yuncheng in 11 hours, once the Yin Yang Mezzanines were completely shut, it would all be too late. What exactly was the inner demon doing? How had it suddenly recruited several Yama-Kings as allies? Who were these unfamiliar high-grade underworld emissaries? The mystery was only continuing to thicken.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For the sake of himself and Safesoul City, there was no way he could allow this prime opportunity to slip through his fingers!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">True energy surged violently through the air, and the eyes of the Taoist priest at the forefront were completely bloodshot. His robes were flapping incessantly as he focused his gaze intently on a certain part of Yuncheng.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several hours ago, the soul lamp belonging to his direct lineal disciple, Yun Kong, had been snuffed out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If it were only his direct lineal descendant, perhaps he wouldn't have been so enraged. However, the Zhengyi Dao was a sect of Taoism in which one could marry, and Yun Kong was his son!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mount Longhu didn't possess any powerful cultivators on par with high-grade emissaries, but it did have the Heavenly Teacher Seal left behind by the original Heavenly Teacher Zhang. In his fit of vengeful fury, he had stormed into the ancestral hall without any hesitation, bringing out the Heavenly Teacher Seal and inviting the 10 elders of the Zhengyi Dao to travel to Yuncheng right away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was gritting his teeth with such force that it felt as if his teeth were about to shatter. \"I don't care who you are, you will pay for this!\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of the Heavenly Teacher Seal, even an Abyssal Prefect would be in significant danger!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, his gaze abruptly settled on a certain place, and he descended rapidly from the heavens. The 10 elders descended behind him like graceful cranes, and they landed on the ground one after another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You! You are the one who killed my son!\" The middle-aged Taoist priest's lips were trembling as he pointed his horsetail whisk directly forward.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an extremely rural area on the outskirts of Yuncheng.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were almost no trees on the vast and empty landscape, and there were certainly no farms or houses. There, in the middle of nowhere, stood a man with a pale complexion and a head of long hair.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From this man's body, the Taoist priest could sense the aura of his son's soul!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on the man's face. \"Greetings, Taoist Master Zhang.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taoist Master Zhang wasted no time with words as the horsetail whisk in his hand expanded rapidly, crossing a span of several dozen meters as it lashed out viciously toward the long-haired man.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had no intention of chatting with the murderer of his own son!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, as the horsetail whisk crashed into the long-haired man's body, the strands of horsehair erupted in all directions and left him completely unharmed. A furious roar rang out as Taoist Master Zhang sprang up into the heavens, then swooped down like an eagle hunting its prey. With a gentle flourish of his horsetail whisk, countless silver threads parted, and a longsword appeared in his grasp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sword was giving off extremely fierce sword energy, slicing a trench that was several meters deep into the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Die!!!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The air seemed to have congealed, and Taoist Master Zhang's fierce killing intent was causing the long-haired man's hair to flap incessantly, while his skin was rippling like the surface of a disturbed pond. However, in the face of Taoist Master Zhang's furious, all-out attack, a smile appeared on the long-haired man's face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Mount Longhu is several hundred kilometers away from here, so I must commend you for making the long journey.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slowly rose up into the air, and inky-black Yin energy surged out of all his orifices. The Yin energy was so powerful and violent that it formed a dark vortex spanning a radius in excess of a kilometer around him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The vortex had taken shape in no more than a second!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"For your troubles, how about I send you to reunite with your son?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin energy exploded violently, and the entire heavens were stained black. Amid the suffocating darkness, a twisted figure that was over 10 meters tall slowly rose to its feet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I am one of the four ominous stars, Envy.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taoist Master Zhang stopped cold in his tracks in mid-air as he stared at the dark Yin energy up ahead with an incredulous expression, as well as the terrifying figure within the Yin energy. Several seconds later, he shuddered as he murmured to himself, \"How is this possible... This is... a Yama-King level evil ghost!\"</span></p>"

The entirety of Yuncheng had been inundated in a sea of white mist, and in the city were at least four Yama-Kings, as well as the inner demon, which was above the Yama-King level. One of the Yama-Kings was facing Taoist Master Zhang in battle, while two of them were closing the Yin Yang Mezzanines in the city as quickly as they could.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All plans had to have an intended goal and a fundamental threshold, but strictly speaking here, the intended goal for Qin Ye's current operation wasn't very clear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What exactly was he trying to do?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was trying to track down the inner demon and find out what it was trying to do by closing the Yin Yang Mezzanines. These were only targets that had sprung into Qin Ye's mind after he became aware of the fact that the Yin Yang Mezzanines were closing. This indicated that at least four Yama-Kings had appeared in Yuncheng, which was comparable to the top-end power of Hell, and he simply couldn't allow himself to rest unless he saw for himself what was happening.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he had a safer way to do this as well, and that was the threshold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That would involve waiting until everything was over, then sending out darkfeathers to investigate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The problem was that by that time, all of the traces would've most likely already been hidden. Given how cautious the inner demon was, it would be extremely unlikely that it would leave anything behind for the darkfeathers to be able to capitalize on. Having said that, it wouldn't be a completely hopeless task. After all, he wasn't the only one who wanted the inner demon dead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just because Hell couldn't find any traces didn't mean that the Heavenly Dao would be in the same boat!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that case, why was Qin Ye insisting on traveling to Yuncheng now? That was because he knew what this plan could potentially escalate into given the right circumstances!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one knew that the Heavenly Dao was also targeting the inner demon, and there was no way that the inner demon would've guessed that the Heavenly Dao would've left Their mark in Qin Zhongguo's soul, nor would it have been able to anticipate that there were already tens of thousands of Yin soldier's gathered beneath the four Yin Yang Mezzanines. Furthermore, Qin Changxin, Qin Xinzhong, and all of the Cathayan Underworld's provincial governors were in the process of deploying hundreds of thousands of troops along with the Wumu military formation to the site as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The four Yama-Kings all had their attention focused on Yuncheng, and given the right opportunity, the Harken would immediately be able to perform a divine descent to arrive at Yuncheng, thereby sealing off the entire city. In that case, the plan would become a true hit job with the four Yama-Kings and three divine artifacts of Hell against the inner demon!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the maximal potential of the plan, and the chances of this actually eventuating were most likely no more than 1%, but if they could succeed, then the inner demon would be struck down once and for all! Thus, even though the opportunity was an extremely slim one, he was still willing to take a gamble.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was flying through the air like a speeding arrow, covering vast distances in the blink of an eye. Amid the all-encompassing sea of mist, Qin Ye could just barely make out the city of Yuncheng up ahead. As for the stockade and living corpses blocking the road, they had already been blown far away by the fierce wind generated by the Heavenly Teacher Seal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a deep breath as he rushed directly toward the toll station, and right at this moment, he habitually checked his watch.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was 3:30 PM, and there were still eight and a half hours left until the closing of the Yin Yang Mezzanines.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had to go faster!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He couldn't fully unleash his Yin energy. Even though all of the Yama-Kings in the city had their attention drawn to Taoist Master Zhang, they definitely wouldn't be distracted for long. Taoist Master Zhang was only an Infernal Judge, even though he was forcing himself to use a Yama-King level divine artifact, there was no way he would be a match for a true Yama-King.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In fact, he would be lucky to survive the battle, and 10 minutes had already passed by since the battle's commencement, so perhaps he had already been defeated.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was traveling as quickly as he dared, and he was drawing closer and closer to Yuncheng. The closer he drew to the city, the more his heartbeat began to accelerate. Once he set foot into the city, he would've stepped into the center of this mystery.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After taking a deep breath, he made one final charge for the toll station. However, no more than half a second after he had rushed through the toll station, his expression abruptly stiffened, and he suddenly exploded into Yin energy before his body reformed again some distance away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He cast an incredulous gaze toward the mist up ahead, then extended a finger forward, and a Soul Shackle shot forth before quickly returning with a strand of something wrapped around its tip.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a thread of interwoven hair.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye gently flicked the thread, and it produced a sound similar to the string of a zither. The string was woven from countless threads of hair, and it was extremely resolute. Qin Ye had a feeling that even if he were to unleash all of his Yin energy, it would not be an easy task to sever the thread.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He raised his head with a surprised expression and cast his gaze forward, upon which he discovered that these threads were littered all throughout the outskirts of Yuncheng! It was like a laser net from a spy film!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were far too many of these threads to count, and they were constantly changing positions rapidly!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were concealed within the mist, making them extremely difficult to notice, and if any Yin spirit were to dare to charge through it, they would instantly be dismembered on the spot.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What on earth is this stuff?\" He cast an incredulous gaze forward.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Could it be that the inner demon was responsible for this?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No, that didn't make sense. Without the sea of mist to support them, these threads didn't pose much of a potent threat, and the mist came from Taoist Master Zhang's Heavenly Teacher Seal. Surely the inner demon wouldn't have anticipated the attack from Taoist Master Zhang.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, these things weren't here before. It was as if the emergence of the sea of mist had triggered some type of chain reaction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In addition to that...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He cast his gaze forward with a grim expression, and right in front of his eyes, the shadow of a massive building had appeared behind the toll station!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He couldn't see exactly what it was. This was a phenomenon triggered by the heavenly teacher seal, which automatically kept out detection from all power systems. All he could see was a shadowy figure that was as vast as a mountain, and right in front of it was what appeared to be a statue of a woman.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The statue had free-flowing clothes and was holding a long flute, but he couldn't see anything beyond that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When had this thing appeared?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">&nbsp;Was this illusion or reality?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, this wasn't the time to be looking at things like this. There was no way that Taoist Master Zhang would be a match for a Yama-King, so time was of the essence for Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After taking a deep breath, he abruptly sprang up like a butterfly in the wind, advancing as he traversed through the tiny gaps between the threads.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if he were dancing on a knife’s edge or charging through a storm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On many occasions,he was almost grazed by the threads in his way, but he was always able to just barely avoid them by the skin of his teeth. The further he advanced, the clearer his mind became. Whoever had set this up had to have been at least a Yama-King. Otherwise, this wouldn't have posed such a severe obstacle even to him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This passageway that was filled with threads stretched on for around 3 km, and right after he passed through the first kilometer, all of the fine hairs all over his entire body suddenly stood up on end. An extreme sense of peril abruptly welled up in his heart, and he immediately ducked his head to the side without any hesitation. Immediately thereafter, a crisp clang rang out and a white mark appeared on his cheek.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye immediately drew to a halt, and gusts of Yin wind revolved around him as he inspected the surrounding threads with a cautious expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They seem to be extending out of heaven and earth, with no origin, nor any end Insight. This was a natural forest, and as was the case with forests, there were often some terrifying killers lurking within them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His gaze fell upon the threads up ahead, and he discovered that a series of paper cutout figures had appeared on them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figures were very simple in design, with round heads and square hands and feet. The only thing remarkable about them were the specks of soulfire burning at their heads.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, all of them were holding paper swords.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire area was completely silent, and there were thousands of these paper figures present, littered all over the path ahead of Qin Ye like snow. One of them had just left that mark on his cheek, so he certainly wasn't going to ignore them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What exactly was hiding in the city of Yuncheng?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was watching these paper figures in silence while countless thoughts were flashing through his mind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why was the inner demon staying in Yuncheng?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why was it that Yuncheng, which was far from a renowned city, had suddenly become the gathering place for four Yama-Kings?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why was it that these threads had appeared upon the activation of the Heavenly Teacher Seal?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He couldn't make sense of this situation, and this wasn't the time to be thinking about things like this. He could already sense a burst of Yin energy drawing closer and closer at an incredible speed, making no attempt to conceal itself at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin energy belonged to a Yama-King, and they were going to arrive here within two minutes!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they were to discover him here, there would be no way for him to advance any further!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, he had to bypass the obstacles up ahead in the next one and a half minutes at most.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He took a deep breath, then released his Yin energy ever so slightly. \"Pardon my intrusion.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, he rose up into the air like a crane, then shot forth rapidly through the air. At the same time, all of the paper figures flew up in unison before forming a military formation that was several hundred meters in size, then rushed toward Qin Ye at the same time with their swords raised!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Neither side was going to back down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that the two sides clashed, a dull thump rang out, and hundreds of paper figures were sent flying backward. Directly ahead of them was Qin Ye, who had a rippling vortex of dark Yin energy around him, which was preventing the paper figures from getting within 10 meters of him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was Ryu Changmin's special ability, Untouchable Love!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In a one-on-one battle against a high-grade underworld emissary, this special ability could only be used sparingly as a surprise tactic, but in the face of a large number of low-level opponents, it was a crushing ability.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figures formed a long stream that extended for over three hundred meters, but Qin Ye was able to fly through it without any impediment. Countless shreds of paper were flying through the air in front of him, and the sound of swords whistling through the air was ringing out incessantly around him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, a sharp scream rang out, and all of the paper figures that had been sent flying converged in unison, quickly forming a snowy white ball. The surface of the ball was constantly undulating, and countless paper figures were piercing their swords into it in a frenzy, producing a string of clangs that rang out in rapid succession.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was continuing to advance rapidly. These paper figures didn't pose much of an obstacle for him, but they clung onto him tenaciously like glue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was impossible to incinerate them using netherfire, and his Heavenly Dragnet was completely ineffective as well. During the short span of half a minute, he tried all of the tricks at his disposal, but was unable to inflict any harm upon these paper figures!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was definitely not a good sign, and he could sense that the Yama-King he had detected earlier was less than 20 kilometers away from him, which meant that a confrontation was going to take place in half a minute more at most.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These paper figures were like a neon sign that he couldn't rid himself of, constantly signaling his location to the enemy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Over three hours had already passed, so the inner demon had most likely already left. Even if it hadn't, the Harken could only encompass an area of a certain size with its spatial seal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the inner demon weren't in that area, then the spatial seal would be futile, and would only startle the inner demon and make it even more cautious.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What do I do? Should I risk it?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin Yang Mezzanines were going to close in less than eight hours!</span></p>"

What's going on?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the residents of Heaven were once the most powerful ancient gods, and if their powers were to interfere with the other two realms, the resulting consequences could be catastrophic. Thus, they were all relegated to Heaven and put into retirement homes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if the other two realms were to completely collapse, Heaven wouldn't do anything, and even someone like Ksitigarbha was only able to project himself down into the two realms. In light of that, how was it possible that such rich immortal energy had appeared here?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The mist surged through Eternahell City in waves, instantly enshrouding the entire city in a sea of white. Amid the boundless immortal energy, Zhao Yun rose up into the sky as a streak of light, then inspected his surroundings with a grim expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">500,000 Yin soldiers were already gathered around Eternahell City, awaiting further instructions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their killing intent was virtually palpable, and they were all raring to go. They were no longer the same newbie soldiers from back when Hell was first established. Having endured countless battles since then, this was truly a ferocious and formidable army, and they were all thirsting for the inner demon's blood!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What do we do?\" Arthis also flew up into the sky with a wary expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This area has been sealed... This is something similar to the Array of the Nine Gods!\" Zhao Yun said as he looked up at the sky. \"Yuncheng is directly above us... If memory serves me correctly, the tomb of Lishan Laomu is situated in none other than Yuncheng.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arthis's eyes immediately lit up upon hearing this. As a Yama-King of Hell, she was naturally aware of who Lishan Laomu was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"An array similar to the Array of the Nine Gods...

Someone's suddenly opened the tomb of Lishan Laomu, so the situation in Yuncheng must've already spiraled into complete chaos! Does Yanluo Qin need our reinforcements? Should we storm the city?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't expecting any message from Qin Ye. This turn of events had taken place extremely abruptly without any prior notice, which meant that Qin Ye himself had most likely also failed to anticipate this. In this urgent situation, he couldn't afford to hesitate or delay!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun's breathing was beginning to become more labored as he felt the weight of the responsibility weighing down upon him. Several seconds later, he closed his eyes and murmured to himself, \"I hope I'm doing the right thing.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He then took a deep breath and abruptly reopened his eyes, then yelled in a thunderous voice, \"Are all of the commanders and generals present?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We're all here!\" Su Daji, Qin Hui and the others immediately stepped forward in response, then cupped their fists in respectful salutes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun gritted his teeth as he raised a hand, and his red cape billowed upward like the scarlet flame of a torch!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Follow me! We must reinforce our King Yanluo!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, Zhao Yun flew up into the heavens as a netherfire phoenix, leaving a massive wave of crimson flames in his wake.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the top of the government building, the Harken licked its lips with a cold expression.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was the most sinister of demons that had lurked in the hearts of man for thousands of years, and it was finally time for them to confront it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a thunderous roar, the Harken transformed into the God of Nine Energies. His body swelled to over 100 meters in length, and it was glowing with light of nine different colors, lending further radiance to the sea of crimson fire in the sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind the Harken, Arakshasa's purple hair was surging like the tide, and countless Yin spirits were revolving around her. As the ruler of the six paths of reincarnation, she was protected by the boundless power of worship in the form of countless specks of white light as she rose rapidly up toward Limbo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Outside of Eternahell City, Su Daji took a deep breath. She was well aware of just how fearsome the inner demon was, but at the same time, it had been centuries since Hell had deployed all of its troops and most powerful beings in full force like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In light of this, she felt like there was nothing to fear!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was only a single being, what could it possibly do against the collective power of Hell?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She gently raised her hand, and her body abruptly exploded into a wave of Yin energy that rose up into the sky behind the three Yama-Kings. \"East Conquering Army, advance!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire sky was inundated by boundless Yin energy, and the enormous ruler of hungry ghosts that had made an appearance back in the Pearl Delta emerged once again with a thunderous roar. Around her were tens of thousands of hungry ghosts, all of which were screeching and writhing as they accompanied their ruler back to the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dark red Yin clouds churned and tumbled behind Su Daji, and a skeletal hound that was over 100 meters in size leaped out before pouncing directly toward Limbo with tens of thousands of other skeletal dogs around it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As all of the commanders and generals sprang into action, all of the Yin soldiers also rose up into the sky as streaks of light, forming a formidable reverse waterfall that completely tore the passageway to Limbo apart!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sight of hundreds of thousands of Yin soldiers rising up toward the heavens at once was truly a breathtaking spectacle to behold, and countless netherworldly citizens of Eternahell City were looking on in awe and wonder. In the sky above, the sun and the clouds seemed to have lost their color, completely outshone by the formidable army that was rising through the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dazzling light shone down upon the faces of all of Eternahell City's underworld emissaries, and they were also looking on with astonishment and amazement. At the top of the government building, Administrative Commissioner Liu Qiankun stroked his own beard with a trembling hand as he declared, \"Long live, Hell!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!\" Governor Mu Shun echoed as he extended a deep bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps their voices had reached the rest of the city, but soon, everyone began to make their voices heard. In the beginning, it was only a slight murmur that was spreading throughout the city, but in the span of less than a minute, it had already crescendoed into a raucous commotion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During year 25 of the third era of Hell, Yanluo Qin, the Reincarnation King, Ghost King Zhao, and the Harken led an army of 570,000 Yin soldiers to strike down the inner demon in the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of the final threat that could pose a threat to the Cathayan Underworld, Hell had chosen to draw its sword!</span></p>"

In particular, Li Lianshun's legs had already given out from under him, and he felt as if he were in a dream.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, no one was paying any heed to him. Li Zhengkai was staring intently at Bai Liangping, who was bleeding out of all of his orifices. Veins were bulging all over his body in a grotesque display, giving him the appearance of a gnarly piece of dried wood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His screams didn't even sound human anymore, and wisps of Yin energy were frantically seeping out of all of his pores.

Instead, his shoulders suddenly rose up and down in a grotesque manner, as if he had no bones. His head then turned 180 degrees, and his blood-red eyes locked on firmly to the people outside. \"Tsk...

It's only taken me less than 10 minutes to possess this body, what could've possibly happened during that time?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His body broke through the top of the building with a resounding boom before appearing in the sky, following which he immediately cast his gaze toward the south. Even though he was already mentally prepared, his heart still sank at the sight that he was greeted by.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The effects brought on by the activation of the Heavenly Teacher Seal wouldn't dissipate so quickly, and the entire city was still inundated in mist. Nothing should've been visible in the mist, but clusters of ancient buildings had appeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only the outlines of these buildings were visible, and in front of these buildings was an enormous statue that stood like a pillar between heaven and earth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was also not completely visible, but just the sight of its outline struck one with an involuntary sense of awe and reverence. In the instant that the inner demon cast its gaze toward the statue, the latter opened its eyes within the sea of mist that covered the entire sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a pair of golden eyes, the pupils of which were in the shape of nine-petaled lotus flowers that were in full bloom, with countless complex runes around them. Given the vast size of the statue, even its eyes were over 100 meters in size, and Bai Liangping was being reflected at the center of the lotus flowers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid a string of audible cracking, the gargantuan statue slowly raised its hand.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As it did so, all of the surrounding cloud and mist receded like the falling tide, and in this instant, all of the people in Yuncheng were looking on with dumbstruck expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">People were packed in front of an apartment window, filming the scene unfolding before their eyes with their cameras and phones. However, upon witnessing the emergence of the deity-like statue, one phone after another fell to the ground, while their owners looked on with their mouths gaped wide open in astonishment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the municipal government building and the Special Investigations Department, all of the public servants and investigators looked up at once, staring at this fantastical scene with dumbfounded expressions. Throughout the entire city, from the main urban area to the outskirts, hundreds of thousands of people witnessed something that they were never going to forget.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The giant statue's raised palm abruptly thrust down toward Bai Liangping, creating a sharp screeching sound as it did so. Layer upon layer of cloud and mist was scattered, and shockwaves spread through the air for several kilometers, making it appear as if the sky were collapsing!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beneath the descending palm, Bai Lianping's clothes had been torn to shreds, and his face was instantly flattened by the powerful shockwaves, but he was displaying no fear at all as he continued to look up with a cold expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of this devastating strike, the inner demon let loose an earth-shattering roar, and Yin energy erupted violently out of its body, immediately following which it also raised a palm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that instant, the entire world seemed to have been muted.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the white mist was instantly cleared away, then quickly converged once again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The clash had gone beyond what could be heard by human ears, and the palm of the enormous statue was stopped cold in its tracks, unable to descend any further!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beneath its palm, Bai Liangping looked up with a vicious expression, and a scarlet vertical eye had already opened up on his glabella. \"Lishan Laomu, I am even older and more regal than you are! You think you have what it takes to strike me down?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A clear cracking sound rang out, and in the next instant, the entire statue of Lishan Laomu shattered violently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless chunks of stone rained down from above, and inky-black Yin energy inundated heaven and earth as a voice that seemed to belong to a deity echoed throughout the entire city. \"I existed before the Buddha. I existed before the patriarch of Taoism. I've seen the entire progression of human history. I've watched you rise up to take over the world, and I've witnessed the history of civilization. How dare you disrespect me?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon's Yin energy fully erupted, and a series of massive cracks spread over the surface of Lishan Laomu's statue like wildfire. Boundless Yin energy erupted out of the cracks, and in a span of less than three seconds, the entire statue had completely shattered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right in the instant that the statue shattered, the inner demon's smile abruptly stiffened.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instead of falling down upon the city as a destructive storm of stone, the massive statue gently drifted down as a shower of flower petals.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Bai Liangping reached out a trembling hand, allowing a flower petal to land on his palm, then immediately looked up at the sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the mist and the shower of flower petals, a holy voice akin to the singing of angels rang out, reverberating throughout heaven and earth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The treasured decree of Lishan Laomu was being recited!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, a pillar of dazzling radiance erupted into the sky above the indistinct tomb of Lishan Laomu, and in the instant that it came into contact with the sky, it transformed into countless specks of white light that rained down from the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The specks of light were drifting down very slowly, and in the instant that they landed on the ground, countless pristine white lotus flowers bloomed across the land!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of this had taken place in the span of less than a minute, and tens of thousands of giant paper figures wielding longswords had already appeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were the Divine Heavenly Guardians!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In contrast with the paper figures that Qin Ye had encountered earlier, each of these was around two meters in size, and they were folded in an extremely meticulous and intricate manner, looking no different from the heavenly soldiers and generals depicted on the comic strips from the 70s and the 80s. They were wielding all types of different weapons, and in the instant that they appeared, they pointed their weapons directly at the inner demon before letting loose a thunderous war cry in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless pillars of light erupted into the heavens around Yuncheng, completely surrounding the city and transforming it into an arena for gods!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How did this happen?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was stunned to see this, and it knew that it wouldn't be able to get away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Southern Purple Palace 10-sided Array was the original form of the Array of the Nine Gods. Who could've anticipated that Lishan Laomu would've set up such an array in her own tomb?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The array was incapable of killing the inner demon, but it had well and truly trapped the inner demon here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who activated this formation, and what objective do they have for trapping me here?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His questions were quickly answered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A resounding boom erupted through the heavens, and an extremely disharmonious burst of crimson appeared within the white mist. It was like a sword of blood that threatened to slice through the entire world, tearing through the heavens and the boundaries between the three realms.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a scarlet netherfire phoenix!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A trail of scorching netherfire was left in its wake, and upon reaching the apex of the heavens, the phoenix turned around in an elegant manner, then converged toward the center to form a blood-red cape that covered half of the entire sky. Standing in front of the cape was none other than Zhao Yun, who was wearing a white robe and holding a silver spear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He pointed his spear directly at the inner demon's head as he declared, \"I am here to slay you once and for all!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With this thunderous declaration, a burst of Yin energy that wasn't much weaker than the inner demon's spread through the entire city. All of the trees in the city were violently flattened, and cracks ran through the ground nearest to the center of the city, while advertisement signs between the city's tall buildings flew through the air like discarded flyers in the wind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, this was only the beginning.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the roars of countless ghosts, a red netherfire lotus flower bloomed in the sky, illuminating the heavens like a giant lantern. Gusts of Yin wind howled as a massive white bone fountain emerged, forming a skeletal vortex in mid-air. Finally, a skeletal throne was formed amid the countless specks of scarlet netherfire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the throne sat Arthis with Soul Shackles clasped in her left hand, and a soul guiding lamp in her right hand. Her legs were casually crossed, and there was a faint smile on her ruby red lips as she gently knocked on the armrest of her throne.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, all of the bones burst into bleak, white netherfire as they screeched in unison, \"The Reincarnation King is here! All hail Her Majesty!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, this was still not the end.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right between Zhao Yun and Arthis, a burst of nine-colored Yin energy tore through the boundaries between the mortal realm and the underworld, forming a dazzling nine-colored galaxy. Within the galaxy was a giant foot standing atop a Yin cloud with nine-colored light revolving around it. In the next instant, an enormous figure burst through into the mortal realm before letting loose a deafening roar toward the inner demon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The roar scattered the clouds and eradicated the mist. Behind them were hundreds of thousands of specks of netherfire, forming a spectacular light show, and with each speck of netherfire that emerged, the Yin energy in the air would become fractionally more formidable.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin soldiers had arrived.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A speck of netherfire descended before transforming into a Yin soldier clad in a suit of black armor, wielding a long spear, and this was immediately followed by a second speck of netherfire, before the rest of the netherfire began to fall one after another in rapid succession.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, hundreds of thousands of Yin soldiers had appeared above the Yin clouds, forming a sea of black in front of the inner demon before aiming their spears directly at him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the sky above was a formidable army of Yin soldiers led by three Yama-Kings, while the ground below was littered with Divine Heavenly Guardians.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no way to escape whether by land or through the sky, and the inner demon was well and truly trapped!</span></p>"

Even though it was a being above the Yama-King level, witnessing an army of over 500,000 Yin soldiers, led by four Yama-Kings, was still a sight that shocked him to the core.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the power of the new Hell!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon took a deep breath, following which a cold smile appeared on its face. \"It won't be that easy to capture my head!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon's forte was its untraceable nature, but having lived for so long, it knew that if it couldn't retreat, then the only option would be to advance with full force!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If it could weather this storm, then it would survive.

His brows furrowed slightly as he did so, and he quickly pulled out a shard of some sort.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a piece of bone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was impossible to tell how old the bone was, but it was yellow with age and riddled with bloodstains.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that the shard of bone appeared, Zhao Yun's pupils immediately contracted slightly, and he launched himself through the air, transforming into a river of crimson above the Yin soldiers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the end of the river was his silver spear, which was flying directly toward the inner demon's throat with incredible speed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun had already reached the peak of his speed, and his Yin energy had been completely released.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had sprung into action so quickly that even the other three Yama-Kings didn't have a chance to react, and he knew that he had to prevent the inner demon from activating that shard!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the inner demon was even faster. After all, it was more powerful than Zhao Yun, and the two of them were separated by a vast distance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of Zhao Yun's devastating attack, the inner demon smiled.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, it tightened its grip around the bone shard, then injected its Yin energy into it in a frenzy. A resounding boom instantly rang out, and right as Zhao Yun reached within 100 meters of the inner demon, a white tide erupted up from the ground, forcibly separating the two.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A violent crashing sound rang out as Zhao Yun's spear plunged firmly into the white tide, but the tide remained intact!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'll remember this, Yanluo Qin, and I'll be sure to repay the favor by a hundredfold in the future!\" The inner demon's cold voice rang out from behind the wall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as its voice trailed off, it vanished on the spot.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was still in Yuncheng.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, Yuncheng was encompassed within the Southern Purple Palace 10-sided Array, so no one could escape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun withdrew his spear with a grim expression, and at this point, Qin Ye had already arrived beside him. Qin Ye extended a hand and laid it against the white tide, upon which he discovered that it was a white skeletal wall that was as tall as the heavens!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had split the entirety of Yuncheng into two.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On one side was Qin Ye and his army, while the inner demon was on the other side.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You can't break through this wall?\" Qin Ye asked with a surprised expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun shook his head in response. \"This is a wall formed by the remains of a being of fortune and worship. No one will be able to break through it.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Ye had a chance to ask, Zhao Yun continued, \"There's only one way to get through it: we have to use blight vermin! With their ability to devour all things, only they can break through this wall.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a name that Qin Ye hadn't heard in a very long time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a brief moment of contemplation, he asked, \"Are there any blight vermin left in Fengdu?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There should be. Fengdu is a massive place, and you've seen their speed before. They had already been devouring each other for over a century before you first saw them, and there were still quite a large number of them back then, so there should at least still be a small portion left.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response and was just about to order Arthis to fetch the blight vermin when Zhao Yun raised a hand to stop him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency, we have to think about this carefully before we make a decision!\" Zhao Yun cautioned with a grim expression. \"Have you considered whose remains were used to activate this wall? Throughout the history of Cathay, there are only two people who are beings of fortune and worship!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye faltered slightly upon hearing this, and the questions that he had already set aside in his mind quickly resurfaced.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why had the inner demon chosen to stay here for so long?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why was the tomb of Lishan Laomu here?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why was it that four Yama-Kings that he had never seen had suddenly appeared here as well?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who were they?\" he asked in a grim voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They were the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou,\" Zhao Yun replied. \"They are both beings of fortune, and the two of them shared the power of worship of the entire nation. Whichever one of them who had won in the end would've been able to create an era for themselves, and in the end, it was the Yellow Emperor who came out on top.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye clasped his hands behind his back as he paced from side to side in an agitated manner. \"There's no way the remains came from the Yellow Emperor, so they have to belong to Chiyou, but Chiyou has no grave! If I recall correctly, Chiyou's body was dismembered by the Yellow Emperor, and the two pieces were dragged in two different directions by two longma that never rested and were perpetually in motion. The two parts of its body are the head and the body... Could it be that the inner demon stayed in Yuncheng for so long because it discovered one of the longma that was dragging along a part of Chiyou's body?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's definitely not the case!\" Zhao Yun shook his head in response. \"Your Excellency, I'm assuming you've never seen a longma before. In fact, the number of longma witnessed by the Yama-Kings of the 10 Palaces and the Sixfold Ghost Kings combined wouldn't exceed three. I had the fortune of seeing one in the past, and there's no way that these creatures can ever be captured. They have a unique property, which is that whatever distance they're away from someone when they're first seen, they'll forever maintain that distance between themselves and the beholder. They are invisible to mortals, and they can traverse freely through the three realms as they please. Even the second King Yanluo most likely won't be able to capture a longma, let alone the inner demon!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't reply, and his brows were tightly furrowed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He couldn't make sense of what was happening.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only being that the bone shard could belong to was Chiyou, but Chiyou had nothing to do with Yuncheng! How had the inner demon obtained that bone shard, and why had it stayed here for so long?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye could sense that he was getting closer to the answer, but it remained just out of reach.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There must be some things that we don't know about hiding in Yuncheng, and those things are what the inner demong is targeting. Perhaps they could even be its trump card! I presume that the emergence of the four Yama-Kings is also closely related to this. My suggestion is that we refrain from unleashing an all-out assault right away,\" Zhao Yun said. \"While the blight vermin are being brought over to Yuncheng, I think it's necessary for us to try and get a grasp on what they're doing. In a world with power systems and cultivation, there are too many secrets, and even a single misstep could result in catastrophic circumstances. We have already reached the final stage of our battle against the inner demon, and we can't afford to risk any lapses in judgment!\"</span></p>"

They've been extremely generous with their investments, particularly in the several decades after the national reform, investing at least several billion into Yuncheng.

Back when I was at the Special Investigations Department, I never heard anything about Yuncheng. Theoretically speaking, with so many hunting areas in the city, the entire city should've been evacuated right away. However, not a single evacuation was staged in Yuncheng throughout the period of natural disasters.

However, the higher the caliber of an array, the more runes and cores would need to be inserted, thereby increasing the amount of area taken up by the array. The problem was that judging from the photographs of the bottomless holes presented by Arthis, they were no more than 30 meters in size each, and there was no way that top-tier arrays could be set up within them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The inner demon could've destroyed these arrays, but it didn't do that,\" Zhao Yun said.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why not?\" Qin Ye immediately asked. \"Why didn't the inner demon destroy the arrays?

How did you know that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun didn't say anything, but he took a few steps backward in a cautious manner, and only then did he reply, \"This is the so-called 'Qimen'.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He pointed toward the center of the platform, then said, \"There is something there, but we can't see it. The eight trigrams lie in the center, while 4,320 objects are situated around it, and that forms the Qimen Dunjia!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qimen Dunjia?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye turned toward the lotus flowers with a perplexed expression as he said, \"Is this really the Qimen Dunjia?

After some refinement, that number was reduced to 1,080, and during the Zhou Dynasty, Jiang Shang compressed it further down to 72 in order to fit the requirements of his marching army. During the Han Dynasty, Huang Shigong passed the Qimen Dunjia down to Zhang Liang, who reformed it once again, making it into its current form, which requires only 18 objects. What we're seeing here is the most primitive version of the Qimen Dunjia. The first field where the Qimen Dunjia was applied was in the military. You can interpret the Qimen as an army, while the Dunjia are the troops within the army. The Qimen's purpose is to conceal the troops, and it's able to do that so perfectly that even when the thing it's concealing is right in front of it, we're unable to see it, nor are we able to sense any Yin energy.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He paused momentarily before turning to Qin Ye, then asked, \"Do you know what the original name of the Qimen Dunjia was?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye shook his head in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His ignorance was being put on full display here!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It was originally called Eight Directions Eight Winds.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This name struck another chord in Qin Ye's mind, and he immediately exclaimed, \"Lishan Laomu's Eight Directions Eight Winds?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course!

Unless Lishan Laomu is here in person, no one will be able to resolve the original version of the Qimen Dunjia, and any misstep could result in life-threatening danger. There's no way for us to see what's on that stone platform, so there's no longer any point in staying here.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as he was about to depart, Qin Ye suddenly grabbed onto his sleeve.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency?\" Zhao Yun turned to him with a perplexed expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You said this was set up by Lishan Laomu herself, right?\" Qin Ye asked as he stared intently at the stone platform.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's right.\" Zhao Yun didn't know what Qin Ye was thinking, but he still explained, \"Only a Yama-King would be able to forge infernal demon sealing chains, and only Lishan Laomu herself can create the original version of the Qimen Dunjia, so this place could only have been created by her.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's heart was thumping in his chest, and he took a deep breath before asking, \"Then why don't we invite Lishan Laomu to come here in person to take a look?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun turned to Qin Ye with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Invite Lishan Laomu here?

Immediately thereafter, Qin Ye tugged on the Soul Shackles, pulling himself up into the air before landing on the chain.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as this happened, a sharp sense of peril suddenly speared into his mind, and all of the surrounding lotus flowers swiveled around in unison to aim themselves directly at Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye immediately crouched down like a leopard on the chain, and amid the silence, a faint buzzing sound was beginning to ring out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the beginning, the sound was very faint, but within the span of just two seconds, it was audibly echoing throughout the entire cave.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun faltered slightly upon hearing this before his expression changed drastically. \"There are more soul devouring beetles!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even without that reminder from Zhao Yun, Qin Ye had already spotted them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of thumb-sized white eggs were floating to the surface from the bottom of the black pond, and they were writhing and struggling frantically, as if they were trying to break free. In fact, many of the larvae had already emerged from the eggs, and a series of golden eyes could be seen opening up within the pond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, the entire pond was illuminated by golden light, resembling a black diamond with gold embedded into it, creating a beautiful scene to behold, but also one that was fraught with lethal peril.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire process took no more than five seconds, and immediately after that, countless arrows of water shot out of the pond before hurtling directly toward Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if the entire pond had sprung to life, and Zhao Yun drew a sharp breath before instinctively rushing toward Qin Ye. However, before he had a chance to reach Qin Ye, he stopped cold in his tracks and looked on with an astonished expression as what appeared to be rain suddenly began to fall from the sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the soul devouring beetles had stopped in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Every single drop of water encompassed an awakened soul devouring beetle, and due to the momentum that was created, it looked as if countless arrows of water had shot out of the pond. However, now that the soul devouring beetles had suddenly stopped moving, the water lost its momentum, and it naturally fell back down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the shower, the soul devouring beetles flew around aimlessly, buzzing around like headless flies above the pond. Several seconds later, all of them plunged back down into the pond, and everything fell still and silent again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun turned to Qin Ye with a shocked expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once a soul devouring beetle chose a target, that target wouldn't be able to escape even if they were to flee to the corners of the world, so why had they suddenly seem to have lost track of Qin Ye from such close range?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Standing on the chain, Qin Ye dabbed at the cold sweat that had beaded up on his forehead. If it weren't for that inspired idea that had suddenly occurred to him, both of them would've most likely already been inundated by that swarm of soul devouring beetles by now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"King Yanluo's Seal saved us,\" he explained as he took a deep breath.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun's eyes immediately lit up upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">King Yanluo's Seal was able to feign true energy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Soul devouring beetles devoured Yin energy for sustenance, and these soul devouring beetles were very strange in that they didn't seem to be able to leave this pond for long, so once their target disappeared, they would naturally return to the pond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It sounded simple, but Qin Ye was teetering on a chain just now, making it impossible for him to take evasive measures, and it was extremely impressive that he was able to think of that on the fly in such a dire situation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the very least, Zhao Yun didn't think that he would've been able to do that in the same situation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is a prison prepared for a soul,\" Qin Ye said. \"I don't know who was buried here, but they were buried here alive without resources, and all they could do was wait for death. After they died, if their soul dared to step out of here, then it would be devoured by countless soul devouring beetles.

Using his Soul Shackles, Qin Ye was able to quickly pull himself to the center of the stone platform, which was less than three meters in size.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An image of the Yellow Emperor was engraved onto the ground, and a part of it had already been pressed down to reveal a hole that was around a meter in size at the center of the stone platform, within which sat a black coffin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that arts had been used here, as evidenced by the fact that half of the stone pillar had been charred black, and there were several clear finger indentations on the ground. It was clear that the inner demon was responsible for this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing as the inner demon had already set the example, all Qin Ye had to do was follow the same process, and thus, he gently pressed his palm against the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of operating mechanical parts rang out, and the entire stone platform began to tremble slightly as the black coffin slowly rose up.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A deep rumbling sound then swept through the entire cave, and right as the coffin emerged, a burst of Yin energy that was as dark as inky slowly seeped out of the gaps alongside streams of blood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A wary look immediately appeared on Qin Ye's face as he jumped onto one of the chains without any hesitation, observing the rising coffin with an intense, unblinking gaze.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was one of the major pieces of the puzzle that was Yuncheng. The secret in this city had convinced the inner demon to take a massive risk, so it was certainly not to be taken lightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right now, this secret was about to be uncovered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the coffin rose up higher and higher, it was stained entirely red by the Yin energy and blood that was gushing out of it. Close to 20 seconds later, the entire coffin had already appeared on the stone platform, while the platform had transformed into a gushing fountain with blood flowing down all around it before sinking to the bottom of the pond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A Soul Shackle abruptly shot out of Qin Ye's sleeve before piercing directly into the coffin, and at the exact same moment, a burst of powerful Yin energy erupted out of the coffin, accompanied by a resentful hissing sound that gradually subsided.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin energy was so powerful that it formed a substantial shockwave, causing all of the surrounding lotus flowers to rear back. Even Qin Ye's robes were flapping incessantly, yet in the face of this abrupt storm, he remained as still and resolute as an immovable mountain, then tugged on his Soul Shackle firmly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A resounding boom rang out as the lid of the coffin was pulled off, then fell into the water below with a dull thump, thereby finally revealing the face of the demon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside the coffin was a boundless expanse of reddish-black Yin energy, within which laid the shriveled up body of a monkey.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't entirely accurate to call it a monkey. The corpse was around two meters tall, and it had to be curled up in order to fit in the coffin. It had a bald spot, but there was sparse white fur growing on its head, extending to over a meter in length, virtually filling the entire bottom of the coffin. Furthermore, they seemed to be alive, and upon encountering light, they began to twist and curl slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The \"monkey\" had three eyes, six ears, and a forked tail. Its arms were incredibly long and encircled around itself, and each hand only had four fingers, but those fingers were over a foot in length, resembling sharp blades.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had clearly already been dead for a very long time, but its body hadn't decayed at all. Instead, it had only become dried and shriveled like a mummy, and blood was gushing out of all of its orifices like a fountain, presenting a harrowing sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was certain that he had never seen or heard of any creature like this before, and he reflexively turned toward Zhao Yun with a dumbstruck expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Zhao Yun was just as befuddled as he was, and he shook his head in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I've never heard of a being like this before, but one thing is for certain: this is a demon. If it were alive, we would refer to it as a demonic immortal. It's definitely a Yama-King level being. Even after its death, its Yin energy refuses to dissipate, and the blood gushing out of the coffin is a result of its excessively powerful Yin energy mutating the surrounding environment. I presume its soul was taken by the inner demon, and we can refer to its soul as a demonic ghostly immortal.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's brows furrowed tightly as he inspected the surrounding area with a grim expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why had this thing been sealed here by Lishan Laomu?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All was going to be revealed soon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"General Zhao!\" Qin Ye called out, then ducked slightly to the side, and Zhao Yun immediately plunged his Courage of Dragons Silver Spear through the entire coffin. From the tail-end of the spear, a Soul Shackle fell into Zhao Yun's grasp, following which an almighty voice rang out, chanting the treasured decree of Lishan Laomu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Initially, the voice was quite faint, but it quickly grew louder and louder until even the walls of the cave were trembling dramatically.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the beginning, one could still clearly tell that it was Zhao Yun's voice, but a few seconds later, it was as if there were countless voices calling out at once.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire pond erupted into a frenzy as the chanting grew louder and louder, and the water in the pond formed inky-black beads that slowly rose up into the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several minutes later, Zhao Yun abruptly clasped his hands together, and a burst of dazzling golden light erupted from his palms. At the same time, all of the water droplets hanging in the air converged at once, forming a huge screen of water while ripples surged through the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside the screen, layers of white clouds were quickly receding into the distance, following which a resplendent golden palace appeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The image was zooming in rapidly, and all of the female servants in the palace turned around with stunned expressions. At the center of the palace was an elegant and regal woman seated with her eyes closed on a phoenix throne.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The image continued to zoom in further and further, and upon reaching within 20 meters of the woman, she finally opened her eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her eyes were golden in color, and her pupils were in the shape of nine-petaled lotus flowers in full bloom. Her expression was aloof and indifferent, and she asked in an authoritative voice, \"Who is seeking me out?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, in the next instant, she abruptly raised her head, and a stunned look appeared on her face as she exclaimed, \"Is that Zhuolu? That's a divine battleground from several thousand years ago! How did you get in there?\"</span></p>"

Not only did he have to deal with the Yama-King that was quickly approaching him, he also had to consider the next set of orders that he was going to issue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was possessing a new host while completely oblivious to the fact that the Yama-Kings of Hell were nearby, and this was a brilliant opportunity!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, if he decided to go ahead with the hit job, then that would lead to a direct battle against the inner demon! If they couldn't kill it, then they would have to face fierce retaliation from it, which would undoubtedly lead to more cities falling to the same fate as Safesoul City.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He only had 10 minutes at most to think. This was a conclusion that he had drawn from the Safesoul City riot. Within 10 minutes, the inner demon was capable of possessing all living beings within a certain area, whether that be an individual or a group.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"><em>What do I do?

He didn't dare to waste any time with unnecessary thoughts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The decision that he was about to make was going to decide the actions of Hell's four Yama-Kings and hundreds of thousands of Yin soldiers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, he raised his head and cast his gaze forward with fierce killing intent in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Get out of my way!\" An enraged voice rang out up ahead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not only were the paper figures standing in Qin Ye's way, they were also posing an obstacle to the oncoming figure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as the furious voice rang out, all of the paper figures up ahead were sent flying, but to Qin Ye's surprise, they didn't converge, and they merely allowed the oncoming figure to pass through without any impediment!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The approaching figure was like Moses parting the Red Sea, and he instantly passed over a distance of several hundred meters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Upon catching sight of Qin Ye, the figure was clearly very much taken aback.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a Taoist priest wearing a blue robe, upon which was embroidered the image of the eight trigrams. His beard was swaying in the wind along with his long sleeves, and he would've appeared quite elegant and refined were it not for the blood all over his body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their eyes met amid the sea of paper figures, and half a second later, Qin Ye exclaimed, \"Taoist Master Zhang?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yanluo Qin?!\" A hint of hope surfaced in Taoist Master Zhang's lifeless eyes, and he immediately flew over to Qin Ye, who swept a sleeve through the air, upon which both of them descended onto the ground. Using his Yin energy, he was able to conceal the Yang energy of Taoist Master Zhang.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The quickly approaching Yama-King was most likely pursuing Taoist Master Zhang. Even with the Heavenly Teacher Seal to assist him, it was clear that Taoist Master Zhang had suffered a heavy defeat, and if Qin Ye didn't conceal his Yin energy, he would be tracked down even if he were to flee to the corners of the world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Strangely enough, with Taoist Master Zhang accompanying him, all of the threads that they encountered quickly parted, and the paper figures ceased to chase them as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye turned toward Taoist Master Zhang with a stunned expression, wondering how he was doing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Was it the Heavenly Teacher Seal? Was it because he was a prominent figure in traditional Taoism?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye cursed internally as he gnashed his teeth together.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was too much information to process, and he didn't know what to do, yet he couldn't afford even the slightest delay or distraction at a time like this!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Should he flee or should he fight?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Should he pretend to not have seen the inner demon's possession, or risk it all in an attempt to hunt down the inner demon once and for all?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both sides had four Yama-Kings, but Hell had hundreds of thousands of Yin soldiers with the Wumu military formation to enhance them, so they certainly weren't completely without chances!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was biting down onto his own lower lip with such force that he was almost drawing blood. Several minutes had already passed by, and the inner demon's possession was most likely about to conclude soon. After all, it was only possessing a normal human.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some decisions had to be made in a split-second, but he simply wasn't decisive enough to do that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gritted his teeth as he checked his watch, upon which he was surprised by the fact that the inner demon's possession was taking so long.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A Soul Shackle was linking Qin Ye and Taoist Master Zhang together, and the latter panted in a strained voice, \"It won't finish that quickly! This is the Bodhimaṇḍa of Lishan Laomu, one of the Six Royals, who rank below only the Three Pure Ones in Taoism!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He seemed to have gleaned Qin Ye's thoughts, and his hand was clasped over his own chest as he continued, \"I've never seen anything as fearsome as that monster in the city, but even he can't do as he pleases in the Bodhimaṇḍa of Lishan Laomu!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lishan Laomu? That's such a familiar name...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He felt so frustrated that his head was about to explode! One piece of information after another was flooding into mind, and all of them were important pieces of information that he had to take into consideration for the decision that he was about to make. He couldn't just ignore any of those pieces of information, but he was also unable to consider them all at once.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, he tugged on the Soul Shackle, and the two of them ducked into the mist off to the side. There just so happened to be a green belt there, so they were perfectly concealed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Almost at the exact same moment, a gust of fierce Yin wind swept over above them, followed by countless specks of netherfire, then continued onward without pause.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as the figure passed through the area, Taoist Master Zhang immediately collapsed onto the ground, panting heavily as he did so.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You won't die,\" Qin Ye said. \"You're not going to die so long as I don't let you die. I have a few questions that I need to ask you. Firstly, who was that just now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taoist Master Zhang gritted his teeth as he forced himself into a sitting position, then reached a trembling hand into his own robe before pulling out a jade vial. He tipped out a golden pill from the vial before swallowing it, and his complexion immediately began to improve at a rate that was discernible even to the naked eye. After closing his eyes and catching his breath for a few seconds, he reopened his eyes as he replied, \"It was Envy... Don't ask me who that is, I don't know the answer to that question myself. No such name has ever been recorded in the tomes of Taoism, and he's not the only Yama-King in this city right now!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"Second question: why are these threads and paper cutouts letting you through?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You don't know why?\" Taoist Master Zhang was quite taken aback to hear this. \"I am one of the Divine Heavenly Guardians, and this is the Bodhimaṇḍa of Lishan Laomu!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Ye had a chance to say anything, he grabbed onto Qin Ye's sleeve as he continued in a fervent voice, \"Lishan Laomu's tomb has always been below Yuncheng! As a result, all evil and demonic beings will be debilitated to a certain extent here. As for the Divine Heavenly Guardians, we are tasked with protecting the tomb of Lishan Laomu!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a glance at his watch again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had already been five minutes since the inner demon had begun its possession.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't know when the possession was going to end, but time was most definitely of the essence here!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He forcibly repressed all of the negative emotions in his heart using the origin runes of desires, then took a deep breath before asking, \"Was the shadow that appeared behind the toll station earlier the tomb of Lishan Laomu? Why is she helping you?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The more urgent the situation was, the more important it became to remain calm and collected. Only then would he be able to make the best decisions as quickly as possible.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never did he think that the tomb of Lishan Laomu actually existed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were countless tombs of vastly renowned figures littered all over Cathay, but it truly came as a surprise to him that Yuncheng, which was by no means an important city, would be the home of Lishan Laomu's tomb!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an extremely impactful piece of information!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was said that she was the one who had felled the Chiyou in a historic battle. She wasn't all that renowned, and she didn't have many believers and worshippers. In fact, she didn't even have a name, which made it seem like she was only some lower god, but in reality, a strong argument could be made that she was worthy of a spot as one of the Three Pure Ones of Taoism.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The city that housed her tomb would definitely not be a place where normal evil ghosts dared to wreak havoc.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, the inner demon and the four Yama-Kings were far from normal evil ghosts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taoist Master Zhang wiped away the blood at the corners of his lips with his sleeves, then asked, \"Yanluo Qin, why do you think our Zhengyi Dao decided to split off from the main branch of Taoism to base ourselves in Mount Longhu?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes immediately lit up as he replied, \"Is it because you're the guardians of Lishan Laomu's tomb?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an important revelation, but it couldn’t resolve the issue that he was currently facing!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, his watch began to glow again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He took a glance at it to find that the red dot that symbolized the inner demon was gradually growing dimmer, which indicated that its possession was about to conclude.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no time left, and he had to make a decision!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye immediately rose to his feet, then waved a dismissive hand, indicating for Taoist Master Zhang to leave.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In one more minute at most, the inner demon's possession would definitely be complete, so he had to make a decision within the next 30 seconds, thereby leaving the Harken and the others 30 seconds to make the required preparations.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yanluo Qin!\" Right at this moment, Taoist Master Zhang rushed over to Qin Ye before falling to his knees, then kowtowed heavily against the ground as he implored, \"Please avenge the Zhengyi Dao!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye immediately grabbed Taoist Master Zhang and hoisted him to his feet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taoist Master Zhang's head was stained with blood, but his expression was very much at ease. Qin Ye gritted his teeth as he said, \"Piss off! This is not something that an Infernal Judge like you can get yourself involved in! Do you know what's happened here? Do you know how many Yin soldiers will have to die to avenge your little sect? Do you know what's at stake here? Get out of my sight!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The rage that was building up in Qin Ye's heart had to be vented somewhere, and he violently threw Taoist Master Zhang aside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Taoist Master Zhang quickly struggled to his feet, and a wry smile appeared on his face as he said, \"Don't lie to me, Yanluo Qin... I know what these injuries entail! How much longer will I have to live? No more than a month, right? I am the current master of the Zhengyi Dao, and once I die, my heir should replace me, but my heir is already dead! They killed my only son! He hasn't fathered any offspring yet, so his death signifies the end of our bloodline!

      "bodyHtml": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Since the early morning, the entirety of Yuncheng had been placed into complete lockdown.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The news broadcasts were repeating over and over again that the lockdown was due to a chemical spill from a factory in the city, but barely anyone was stupid enough to believe that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The air temperature was rapidly plummeting, and some people had seen reflections of countless soldiers wearing antiquated armor on their windows. Some had taken photographs of people that couldn't be seen in the lens, and some had clearly heard the sound of clanging footsteps ringing out on the empty streets outside. The decade of supernatural disasters had only passed by not long ago, so it was still very much fresh in many people's memories.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone began to pull out their talismans before hanging them up at their doorway with red thread, and in no more than three hours, the entire city seemed to have returned to the days of the supernatural disasters. Talismans were swaying in front of every household, and all windows and doors were tightly shut as everyone stayed indoors in fear and unease.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thankfully for them, no one disturbed them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Neither side wanted to make the situation more complex than it already was, particularly the inner demon. They didn't want to have to deal with the mortal realm while also facing Hell.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Four hours after all of the Divine Heavenly Guardians had appeared, they transformed into sheets of paper that drifted down all over the city.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if they had gone into standby mode, having not received any orders for too long.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The white skeletal wall that ran across the entire city was an extremely eye-catching sight. A battle was about to break out between the two sides, but they had been forcibly separated by the wall. As a result, they were forced to calm down, but at the same time, this only meant that the battle was going to be even more ferocious when it did commence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The wall was like a dam that was keeping out a flood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The longer it held the flood at bay, the more the pressure was going to build.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The municipal government had done everything in its power to keep the citizens of the city safe. Everyone was staying indoors, so Yuncheng was made to appear like a completely dead and deserted city.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A boot gently stepped onto the ground, and Qin Ye slowly emerged amid a gust of Yin wind. Right behind him was Zhao Yun, who was virtually always by his side.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There was no need for you to follow me here,\" Qin Ye said.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun shook his head in response, but didn't say anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was already an advanced Yama-King, so there were very few beings in the world who could pose a threat to him, but Zhao Yun still insisted on following him in case any unforeseen circumstances arose.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two of them had arrived at an abandoned playground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a playground that was purchased for 100,000 in 1955, which was a massive sum back then. Several supernatural events had taken place here, so no one dared to purchase this plot of land, and thus, it had been abandoned this entire time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The playground wasn't paved with concrete as modern playgrounds were. Instead, it was a dirt playground, and the removal of rocks had been done very well, so it was clear that the person who had built this school had put in a lot of love and effort.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unfortunately, in the face of the power of capitalism, the school had fallen into ruin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The playground wasn't very big, and at its center was a tall pole. That was a pole used to mount the national flag, and its color had already completely faded. A tattered national flag was hung up at half-mast, and it was flapping in the wind in a pathetic manner, as if it were lamenting its past glory days.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The school building was constructed from red bricks, and at the time, this would've been quite a nice school. At this point, half of it had already collapsed, and the remaining half was covered in vines, giving it a particularly decrepit and eerie appearance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the first digging site that the Jiang Group had invested in.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye closed his eyes to inspect the surrounding area with his consciousness, and several seconds later, he reopened his eyes. \"The Yin energy here is very pronounced, but it's not very powerful.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was quite strange. Most of these evil ghosts had only been released recently, and there was no way that their Yin energy should've dissipated in such a short time. The Yin energy that belonged to them would have clear signs through which their owners could be identified, but that wasn't the case here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Perhaps it's been tampered with,\" Zhao Yun suggested with a grim expression. \"They wouldn't want the Special Investigations Department to grow suspicious. Normal people can't enter this place, but if the Special Investigations Department finds out what's happening here, Hell would be quickly notified as well.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Zhao Yun had a chance to continue, Qin Ye shook his head as he interjected, \"That doesn't make sense! The timeline is off!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of these evil ghosts had only been released recently, which meant that the inner demon would've definitely already realized that the Emissaries of Hell were no longer present in the mortal realm. As such, it wouldn't care if the Special Investigations Department detected anything or not.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, the inner demon had to dig over 1,000 of these bottomless holes on its own, and it was very unlikely that it would've had the time to carefully conceal the secrets below them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the very most, it would only be able to make some rough concealments.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Brother Zhao.\" He turned to Zhao Yun before giving him a nod, then stepped aside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun took a deep breath, and his Yin energy surged out of his body in a frenzy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The terrifying Yin energy swept through the entire area like fierce wind blowing away the mist, and the things that were concealed here were no longer able to remain hidden. No more than three seconds later, Zhao Yun abruptly raised his head before gently stomping his foot onto the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of cracks extended from his feet, and they were growing larger and deeper by the second, while wisps of reddish-black Yin energy were already beginning to seep upward.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the short span of just 10 seconds, the cracks had already spread over the entire playground, and a resounding boom rang out as the ground gave out from under their feet, sending them falling downward.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A hole with a radius of around 20 meters had appeared at the center of the playground, and it was extremely deep.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even after falling for a full minute, the bottom still wasn't in sight. Qin Ye raised his head to find that at this point, the sun had been reduced to around the size of a table tennis ball from his perspective, and there was nothing but complete darkness around them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Within the darkness, there was a bone-chilling aura that was rapidly spreading. Darkness had no effect on underworld emissaries, and Qin Ye could clearly see that a type of reddish-black mist had already formed a bottomless vortex beneath them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is Yin energy.\" He reached out a hand, and the mist rose up to meet him as if it had found its owner, wrapping around his finger to form a loop. Qin Ye shook his head as his brows furrowed slightly. \"But at the same time, it's not Yin energy.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was fundamentally the same as Yin energy, but it was behaving completely differently!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yin energy for Yin spirits was equivalent to blood for humans. It was something that only Yin spirits possessed, but this particular type of Yin energy was filled with all types of negative emotions associated with war, causing it to change color into a third type of Yin energy that Qin Ye had never seen before.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin energy of Limbo was azure, the Yin energy of the underworld was black, and this Yin energy was a reddish-black color.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin energy had already formed a ball above Zhao Yun's palm, and after inspecting it for a long while, he said, \"This is Yin energy from before Hell emerged. The Yin energy of Hell is black because it was formed by the remains of the Goddess Earth Mother. However, Yin energy that hasn't ever passed through Hell is different.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ball of Yin energy disintegrated as he gently crushed it, and his brows furrowed tightly as he inspected the surrounding area with a cautious expression. \"I can't think of who could've possibly been buried here. It has to have been a powerful ancient god whose physical body already ceases to exist. During the time they were around, Hell didn't exist yet, and no one realized that spirits could also cultivate. Their cultivation aptitude is definitely not inferior to mine, and over a long period of time, they found a way to cultivate. There's a very good chance that this has something to do with the official founding of Hell after the Goddess Earth Mother transformed into the six paths of reincarnation. The formation of Hell affected all of the living beings in the world, and the being that was buried here most likely sensed something, thereby allowing them to cultivate on their own to the Yama-King level.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A grim look appeared on Qin Ye's face. This was definitely not good news. Over the past several thousand years, only around 20 Yama-Kings had emerged in Hell, yet whoever had been buried here had reached that level on their own.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just how fearsome would they have been during their living days?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both Zhao Yun and Qin Ye fell silent. It felt as if there were a monster lurking within the darkness, ready to pounce at any moment, and there seemed to be no end to this darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Half an hour later, Qin Ye's brows had become tightly furrowed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no way that such a deep hole could possibly exist!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It would take around seven minutes to complete a 5,000-meter fall, but we've already been falling for at least half an hour at this point, which would be equivalent to falling 25,000 meters.\" He raised his head and pointed upward as he spoke. \"Look.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun looked up as he was told, and his pupils immediately contracted slightly. The sun was still around the size of a table tennis ball above their heads. If they really had already fallen for 25,000 meters, the sun would've faded out of view long ago!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Could there be an array here that confounds the senses?\" Qin Ye murmured with tightly furrowed brows. \"The fact that it works on us means that the one who created the array has to at least be an advanced Yama-King. On top of that, an array that's this well concealed, yet able to affect Yama-Kings, must be extremely renowned, but I can't think of any that would fit this description...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The one who had set up this array had to be extremely skilled in their craft, perhaps even unmatched throughout all of history!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, the array wasn't impossible to dispel.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It can confound the senses, but it can't conceal objects.\" A faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face, and his Heavenly Dragnet abruptly erupted out of his sleeve, flying straight down for around half a minute before a clang finally rang out from down below.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, that was immediately followed by a loud buzzing sound.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was like the sound of a bee's nest, except amplified manifold, and in the instant that the sound rang out, Qin Ye and Zhao Yun's expressions both changed slightly as they released their emissary auras without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It appeared that they had just activated a trap. This was an array left behind by someone who was at least an advanced Yama-King, so it would certainly be unwise to underestimate the traps here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Less than five seconds later, a burst of golden light appeared behind the reddish-black mist. The golden light was moving extremely fast, like a pack of starving wolves that had finally encountered some fresh meat. A deafening boom rang out, and tens of thousands of tiny black insects appeared around Qin Ye and Zhao Yun with wisps of reddish-black mist trailing along behind them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At such close range, Qin Ye was able to see these insects clearly, and they resembled flying beetles with translucent green rings beneath their hard black shells. Their eyes were glowing with greedy, golden radiance, and drops of bright red liquid were dripping down from their mandibles.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"These are Soul Devouring Beetles!\" Zhao Yun exclaimed, and in the next instant, the swarm of beetles converged toward them from all directions in a frenzy amid a sharp screeching sound!</span></p>"

At this point, he truly knew everything that he needed to know, and all that was left was to unleash an all-out attack!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye slowly unfurled the bamboo scroll, then gently traced his fingers along its surface. The monkey that they had just seen in the coffin was etched on the first page of the scroll.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though it was a very simple drawing, it captured the spirit and image of the monkey perfectly.

He was a white monkey who attained intelligence, with three eyes, six ears, and two tails, and he perished during the Battle of Zhuolu. No records of him can be found in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lust, a nascent Yama-King who is one of the four ominous stars under Chiyou's command.

He was an ox who attained intelligence after 1,300 years of cultivation, with a body as massive as a mountain, the head of a cow, the body of a human, and legs of a spider. He perished during the Battle of Zhuolu, and no records of him can be found in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Insanity, a mid Yama-King who is one of the four ominous stars under Chiyou's command. He was a 900-year-old mandrill with no substantial body, formed entirely by Yin wind.

Qin Ye did a quick count to find that there were 12 Abyssal Prefects, while the rest were all Infernal Judges and Anitya Hellguards. With the 73 immortals thrown into the mix as well, the forces under the inner demon's command were far more powerful than Hell had imagined!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was also the Myriad Soul Pagoda that they would have to contend with, and things were looking far from optimistic.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A battle definitely had to happen.

Furthermore, if they were to allow the inner demon to get away, they would be facing fierce retaliation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, how were they supposed to fight such a formidable enemy?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There won't be any chances to pick them off individually. I'm sure that they're all staying together on the other side of the wall, and if I were to go to the other side, I would immediately be detected by the inner demon,\" Zhao Yun said in a grim voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye gently closed the bamboo scroll as he shook his head. As things currently were, they were only evenly matched with the inner demon's forces at most, and under these circumstances, it would be virtually impossible to kill the inner demon. However...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He raised his head to look up at the sky as he said, \"Rest assured, we still have an important ally who hasn't arrived yet.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who is it?\" Zhao Yun followed his gaze upward, then asked with furrowed brows, \"Are you referring to the Heavenly Dao?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. This was one of the main reasons he had decided to strike.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was over 90% sure that the Heavenly Dao would intervene!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No decision was ever made in a vacuum. Under different circumstances and at different times, different decisions had to be made.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao was a transcendent and detached being, so it made sense that They didn't care about the fall of Hell.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if all three realms were to collapse, They would just have to wait several million years until the next batch of intelligent living beings appeared. Perhaps those beings wouldn't even be humans, but what did that matter?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"However, things are different now,\" Qin Ye said. \"The existence of extraterrestrial gods can pose a direct threat to the Heavenly Dao Themself. They had never shown Themself in the past, but up to this point, They had already appeared twice, with the first occasion taking place during the plot of the three Caribbean death gods.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He turned to Zhao Yun before asking, \"What do you think this entails?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun's brows furrowed slightly as he replied, \"The Heavenly Dao is taking a more hands-on approach with the affairs of the world. Could it be about to fully descend upon the world soon?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's right. The existence of extraterrestrial gods has struck fear into Their heart, so They must ensure that the three realms possess sufficient power to weather this storm. Do you know how I managed to gauge the mindset of the Heavenly Dao?\" Qin Ye asked with a cunning smile. \"When have you ever seen the Heavenly Dao make a request to anyone to kill a being above the Yama-King level in Their stead?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The existence of the inner demon had already affected the balance of the three realms.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once again, in the past, the Heavenly Dao would've simply turned a blind eye to this. However, the inner demon had chosen to collaborate with extraterrestrial gods, thereby allying itself with the Plumed Serpent God, and that was something that the Heavenly Dao absolutely could not tolerate!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why aren't They doing this Themself?\" Zhao Yun asked with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye replied, \"You haven't directly communicated with the Heavenly Dao before, so you don't know what They're like. Let me give you an example. The Yellow Emperor had already defeated Chiyou thousands of years ago, and the era of the human race was about to begin, so why was it that Chiyou was still able to leave behind something like the Myriad Soul Pagoda? Don't you think that it's completely pointless and poses a constant underlying threat to the human race?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun contemplated this in silence for a long while before replying, \"Beings above the Yama-King level are able to sense many things that they were unable to in the past, such as the Great Dao. The Great Dao has a total of 50 major branches, and those major branches split up further into countless minor branches. It encompasses the rules by which the world functions. For example, when someone gets hungry, they have to eat, and when fish leave the water, they'll die, etc. However, among the 50 major branches of the Great Dao, one of them is the dao of unpredictability, and I think that best explains the Heavenly Dao's attitude on this matter.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response to Zhao Yun's sound analysis, then asked, \"Do you think the Heavenly Dao can count as a living being?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Zhao Yun had a chance to reply, Qin Ye answered his own question. \"No, They are a machine. They are the epitome of the laws of the world, and They can never break Their own laws. Thus, They accepted the unpredictable element that was left behind by Chiyou's forces. At the same time, They allowed the unpredictable entity that is the inner demon to exist. Among the 50 major branches of the Great Dao, there has to be one that states that the Heavenly Dao is prohibited from interfering with the operation of the world. This is not difficult to extrapolate. In fact, it's very obvious from Their past actions. However, as the inner demon slowly transformed from an unpredictable entity to a predictable threat that had allied itself with the extraterrestrial gods, the Heavenly Dao was no longer able to remain aloof and detached. At the same time, They felt a sense of shame as the representative of the laws of the world, feeling as if They had gone against the purpose of its own existence. Thus, They chose me to kill the inner demon for them. However, we now know that the inner demon is far more powerful than we anticipated. If we fail, we won't be able to track down the inner demon again unless we kill the entire population of Cathay. If we were to do that, the three realms would be thrown into severe imbalance, and that would make this world completely vulnerable to the extraterrestrial gods. Hence, the Heavenly Dao can't allow us to fail, and I wouldn't work for Them for free, either. What do you think of my analysis, Nothingness?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun faltered slightly upon hearing this, then immediately reflexively positioned himself in front of Qin Ye as a shield.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just now, a humanoid figure had suddenly appeared behind Zhao Yun and Qin Ye, looking as if it had been standing there the entire time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun immediately turned around, and with just a single glance, he was able to gauge how powerful this being was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Its power was as unfathomable as an abyss, but without entering the abyss, one would be completely unable to sense just how fearsome its power was. Even Zhao Yun was struck by an indescribable sense of fear in the presence of the Heavenly Dao, and this was only a manifestation of the Heavenly Dao.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He instantly released his Yin energy without any hesitation, forming an inky-black wall of energy as he looked on with a wary expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nothingness took a glance at Zhao Yun, then turned toward Qin Ye, and They remained completely expressionless the entire time, as if nothing in this world were capable of piquing its interest. \"How presumptuous of you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Presumptuous? I think not,\" Qin Ye countered with a smile. \"The fact that you've appeared here means that my analysis was all correct. You want us to take you into consideration when we're deciding on our strategy, right?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nothingness remained silent, and before They had a chance to speak, Qin Ye continued, \"This is the third time that you've appeared. You've witnessed the entire history of the world, and even during the most arduous times for the human race, the most that you did was pass down some divine edicts in order to provide some vague guidance to our ancestors. However, you've already descended upon this world three times in less than 30 years. Is the threat of the extraterrestrial gods already this severe?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the Heavenly Dao possessed human emotions, it would've most likely already slapped Qin Ye across the face!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One could only get away with this type of gloating in the face of a completely emotionless machine.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was staring intently at the Heavenly Dao. He was further affirming his own hypothesis that the Heavenly Dao was indeed an emotionless machine. A clear understanding of the Heavenly Dao's mindset could be very useful in the future.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao paid no heed to Qin Ye's blatant probing, and perhaps They didn't care anyway. After a long silence, They finally said, \"You won't be able to break through the Myriad Soul Pagoda. That is something that has inherited the fortune and faith of a generation. Truth be told, during the Battle of Zhuolu, even I couldn't tell who was going to win as their fortune was the same. The Yellow Emperor won in the end, taking away half the fortune to establish the era of the human race. Chiyou lost, and the other half of the fortune transformed into the Myriad Soul Pagoda to be buried beneath Zhuolu. What you're facing is not the inner demon. Instead, it's half of the fortune of Cathay, and the faith and worship vested in Chiyou and his forces.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So?\" Qin Ye prompted.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For some reason, Nothingness was struck by the urge to hit something, but that urge quickly faded. They couldn't understand why Qin Ye was so smug and self-assured in a situation like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I will break through the Myriad Soul Pagoda for you.\" After that parting sentence, Nothingness's body began to fade.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're not going to kill the inner demon yourself?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no response, and the Heavenly Dao vanished just as abruptly as They had appeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency...\" Zhao Yun turned to Qin Ye, but the latter merely shook his head and remained silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long silence, Qin Ye finally mused, \"Does this mean that the Heavenly Dao believes that we have the power to kill the inner demon if the Myriad Soul Pagoda is broken?\"</span></p>"

Even though there were powerful beings like us during those times, we were opposed by all types of immensely powerful beasts, evil ghosts, and demons. The Jiuli Tribes and the Xuanyuan Tribe were active in Shanxi and Shaanxi. This has already been proven by modern historians, and they've even uncovered ruins of those civilizations. They are correct in that assessment. Bodies of water have always bred civilizations, and almost all civilizations on Earth have been established along rivers, lakes, or seas. Thus, an extremely important problem arises.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye had already identified this problem, and he asked, \"Is it distance?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's right!\" Lishan Laomu replied in a serious voice. \"According to the segregation of historians, the area in which the Xuanyuan Tribe was active at the time was over 900 kilometers away from Zhuolu of Hebei Province, which means that they were over 800 kilometers away from the Jiuli Tribes.

Both of them have the exact same pronunciation, but obviously, different characters are used.]</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She slowly wrote the correct spelling of Zhuolu in mid-air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is the correct spelling.\" A reminiscent look appeared on her face as she sighed, \"In ancient times, the Weihe River and the Yellow River converged at Tongguan, and the water there is quite murky, thereby accounting for the 'zhuo' in the name. Back then, when looking out at Fenglingdu from Tongguan, one would see a vast highland that stretched for several dozen kilometers, and that is the 'lu'.\" [In Chinese, 浊(zhuo) translates to murky, and 陆(lu) translates to land.]</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tongguan... Zhuolu...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was quickly assessing the map of Shanxi in his mind, and several seconds later, he drew a sharp breath as he abruptly raised his head to look at the screen of water.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If his memory served him correctly, then Zhuolu was situated right at the foot of Lishan Mountain. Furthermore, according to historical records, the territory of the Xuanyuan Tribe wasn't far away from that of the Chiyou Tribe.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, it was very much possible that a battle could've taken place between them at Zhuolu, and Zhuolu was certainly a large enough place to facilitate such a battle!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thus, the true Zhuolu isn't in Hebei Province at all. Instead, it's right beneath your feet!\" Lishan Laomu declared. \"The ancient battlefield of the Battle of Zhuolu is located in the southwestern area of Ruicheng County of Yuncheng, in a place known as Fenglingdu. It was also there that the two parts of Chiyou's body were dragged away in two different directions by longmas. After I ascended to Heaven, I set up my tomb here to seal all of the demonic deities buried in Zhuolu. At the time, Chiyou's army had 82 branches and 4,320 cultivators. Thus, I created the Qimen Dunjia to seal them all near my tomb!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The story was very simple and concise, and it was over very quickly, but Qin Ye and Zhao Yun were still reeling from what they had just heard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who could've imagined that a nondescript city like Yuncheng would be harboring such an astonishing secret?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Up to this point, all of their questions had been answered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why had the inner demon stayed in Yuncheng for so long? Where had these unknown Yama-Kings come from? Why was it that the skeletal wall had kept the inner demon and the others in the half of the city where Ruicheng County was situated?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Also, why had Lishan Laomu participated in that battle from all those years ago?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She wasn't one of the Yellow Emperor's subordinates. In fact, she was his teacher. She was all alone, but she was extremely powerful, and even if she didn't actively participate in the battle, there was no way that the Yellow Emperor or Chiyou would engage her in battle.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time, she simply had no choice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their armies were already on the doorstep of her Bodhimaṇḍa, and if she didn't pick a side, the safety of her Bodhimaṇḍa would be under threat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Upon picking a side, she had an agenda that she had to fight for.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time, the Yellow Emperor had just so happened to have been trapped by the Wind God and the Rain God, and Lishan Laomu had saved him from that predicament. As a result, she had earned herself a lofty status, ranking below only the Three Pure Ones!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She preferred to keep a low profile, so she wasn't all that renowned, but that didn't mean that she wasn't one of the most important figures when it came to shaping the history of Cathay!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">So why exactly had the inner demon come here?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The answer was already very obvious at this point: he wanted to release all of the demonic deities that had been sealed here!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why had it chosen to ally itself with Chiyou's subordinates? It was because the Jiuli Tribes were natural enemies to the entirety of Cathay!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The very existence of this nation was a constant reminder of their defeat and humiliation! If they couldn't destroy this nation, then they would be bringing shame to their bloodline!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were perfect allies for the inner demon and extraterrestrial gods!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I see...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Having finally made sense of everything, an enlightened smile appeared on Qin Ye's face. He described the situation in Yuncheng to Lishan Laomu, then asked, \"What is the inner demon trying to do now? Would you be able to impart your wisdom upon us?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I wouldn't dare to say I have much wisdom,\" Lishan Laomu replied with a modest smile. \"According to what you just told me, it's clear that the inner demon knows what it's doing and has kept the half of the city that includes Ruicheng County for itself. If I recall correctly, the final device that can allow Chiyou's forces to make a return can be found in Ruicheng County, and that is the Myriad Soul Pagoda. It's said that if Chiyou's body were reunited with his head, then he would be able to be resurrected in the Myriad Soul Pagoda. This is an indestructible array created by Chiyou and all of the demonic deities under his command, and once activated, Chiyou will begin a revival process. However, it can only be used once every 1,000 years.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Myriad Soul Pagoda was most likely the inner demon's final trump card. However, the inner demon didn't possess both parts of Chiyou's body, so it was most likely only aiming to take advantage of the indestructible nature of the array to outlast the Southern Purple Palace 10-sided Array, which could only stand for four days.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you sure there's no way for Chiyou to be resurrected?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lishan Laomu paused momentarily before replying, \"Theoretically speaking, it's not impossible. Longmas are impossible to catch in this world, but one person has seen the longmas in the past and even stroked them before.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who is it?\" Zhao Yun asked in a stunned voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's the one who released the longmas, of course,\" Lishan Laomu replied.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Someone had to have tied Chiyou's body to the tails of the longmas. In that person's eyes, the longmas are always right in front of him, and he could easily reach out and touch them at will. They are the only person capable of that in this world, but who knows if their bloodline still exists after these past thousands of years? It would certainly not be an easy task to trace back thousands of years to try and track down a single person. At the very least, no one in Heaven would be capable of doing that.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye sighed as he repressed that thought, and just as he was about to bid farewell to Lishan Laomu, she suddenly said, \"Please wait, Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shen then gently pointed a finger forward, and two specks of golden light passed through the screen of water before landing in Qin Ye's grasp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of them was a bamboo scroll, while the other was a jade hairpin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A forlorn look appeared on Lishan Laomu's face, but it quickly faded as she said, \"This event is directly related to me as well. It was I who assisted the Yellow Emperor in defeating Chiyou all those years ago, and now, the burden should fall upon me to resolve this matter once and for all. Perhaps it was meant to be that you stumbled upon all of this in Yuncheng. That bamboo scroll is a list of all of the powerful cultivators under Chiyou's command, including the four ominous stars, the 12 demonic spirits, and more. As for the jade hairpin...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on her face, and the screen of water slowly vanished, dripping back down into the pond. \"I have a feeling that there will come a time where you'll have to use it.\"</span></p>"

Over the past two decades, Su Daji and Qin Hui had also become more powerful, and with their Hungry Ghost Legion and Asura Legion, which combined to over 100,000 troops, coupled with the Wumu military formation, it certainly wasn't impossible for them to keep Resentment at bay.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response.

No one knew what had been buried here several thousand years ago.

The mountain range to the left resembled a prowling predator, representing the White Tiger. The upper mountain range spread open to either side, resembling the Vermillion Bird spreading its wings to take flight, while the mountain range in the rear was flat and smooth, much like the shell of the Xuanwu Turtle.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of that, in addition to the fast-flowing river, made this an extremely perilous place in a fengshui context, and whatever was buried here would be condemned to a fate of suffering for eternity, but even a slight mishap could result in terrifying corpse mutations.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Standing atop a stone mountain was a short being with a head that resembled the skull of a crow, and two balls of netherfire burning in the eye sockets.

The enamel layer all over its entire body was riddled with countless tiny holes, and gusts of Yin wind were taking on the form of corkscrews before gushing into the holes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a longear, one of the lowliest members of the 82 divisions under Chiyou's command.

These were the elite members of the Nigu Division and the Xinglan Division, and they were releasing formidable netherfire and Yin energy. Anyone who passed through this place would immediately be met by a fierce assault from these beings.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, they weren't the most powerful forces here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The longear cast its gaze further into the distance, where a fearsome Yin energy vortex could be seen. The enigmatic Many-faced God and all of the four ominous stars were in there, as well as the Myriad Soul Pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The longear heaved a silent sight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had already been defeated once at Zhuolu, were they going to be able to reverse the outcome of history here on this occasion?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Jiuli Tribes were no longer as powerful as they had been in their heyday, but the main forces were still present!

It could see that all of the scouts around it had stood up.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was no illusion!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A voice was screaming frantically at it in its mind as right in front of the eyes of all of the scouts, an opening had appeared on the vast skeletal wall on the horizon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that instant, it was as if time had fallen completely still.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside the vortex of Yin energy, the inner demon abruptly raised its head before casting its gaze toward the Thousand Tribulation Wall. \"Have they broken through it already? As expected of the most powerful underworld in history...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy also raised his head, and in the blink of an eye, all of the Yin energy in his entire body began to surge and churn violently, while vengeful spirits formed by Yin energy drifted out of his orifices incessantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Come!

It was far too apparent, like an ink blotch on a pristine sheet of white paper. As the crack continued to widen further and further, wisps of pure black Yin energy that represented Hell began to seep through.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">More and more cracks began to appear, and they were widening rapidly. After no more than a minute, the entire wall was already riddled with cracks, and so much black Yin energy had seeped through that half of the sky had turned pitch-black.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone was looking on and waiting with bated breath. It was clear that the instant that the Thousand Tribulation Wall fell would be the instant that this historic battle began.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right around the minute mark, the Thousand Tribulation Wall finally collapsed, unable to hold itself upright any longer. Immediately thereafter, hundreds of inky-black insects crawled through, frantically gnawing away at the Thousand Tribulation Wall, which was still collapsing at an alarming speed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, no one paid any heed to this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even as massive sections of the wall collapsed one after another, no one took a single glance at it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone's attention was focused on the hundreds of thousands of Yin soldiers standing behind the wall. They were gathered in an orderly formation with a vast wall of Yin energy from the four Yama-Kings in front of them, presenting a breathtaking and formidable sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Fierce gusts of wind suddenly began to sweep through the area, causing the flags of Hell carried by the Yin soldiers to flap incessantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the tense and bloodthirsty atmosphere, Qin Ye slowly reached out a hand. He was standing at the forefront of the army, and boundless Yin energy gathered around him, following which an inky-black longsword suddenly appeared in his grasp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gently grabbed onto the hilt of the sword, then pointed its tip directly at Zhuolu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The scouts at the forefront finally realized what was happening, and they screamed in terror as they rushed back as quickly as they could. Behind them, the armies of the Nigu Division and the Xinglan Division were already crouching down onto the ground, preparing to charge ahead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a moment in history that was going to be eternally remembered, a battle that would put an end to a conflict that had been raging for as long as the human race had existed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, Yin energy erupted violently, and a burst of loud buzzing rang out over the ground as Qin Ye sped toward Zhuolu on his own like a lone eagle soaring over the desert!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was like an injection of stimulants directly into the souls of all of the underworld emissaries, causing their adrenalin to spike through the roof. At the same time, the thunderous sound of pounding war drums rang out, and Zhao Yun pointed his spear directly forward as he commanded, \"Charge!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!!!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun's order was met by countless war cries, and heaven and earth trembled as the army of over 600,000 Yin soldiers charged ahead as a single unit!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The tens of thousands of skeletal warhorses at the forefront lowered their heads in unison, and the heavy cavalry they were carrying on their backs formed the first wave.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the warhorses were charging close beside one another in rows, forming impenetrable walls that galloped ahead like unstoppable juggernauts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With hundreds of thousands of Yin soldiers charging forward at once, the entire earth was quaking and groaning violently. The formidable army was bulldozing straight through all landmarks in their path, and their eyes were set on one thing and one thing only: Zhuolu!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the ground began to quake and rumble, the inner demon's eyes abruptly sprang open, and it was suddenly struck by a sense of foreboding.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had failed to anticipate that Hell's army would be so uniform and well organized. The collective killing intent and unstoppable momentum of Hell's advancing army was significantly boosting their morale while denting the morale of the opposing army and striking fear directly into their hearts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Battle of Zhuolu had taken place at far too early a point in history, at a time when military formations didn't exist. Thus, they had never seen such a massive army advance in such a uniform fashion, and it felt as if they were facing a force of nature, striking them with a sense of powerlessness and despair.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were accustomed to a far more primitive style of battle, which were essentially massive, chaotic melees without any formation or organization to speak of, and they had never faced a well-trained army that was armed to the teeth, such as the one they were facing now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This army had slowly developed year after year alongside the advancement of Hell. Their discipline and fearlessness had been forged through countless battles, and it was upon those experiences that they built their unshakeable confidence and unwavering resolve.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Stop them!\" the inner demon yelled frantically. Chiyou's army had never undergone any formal training, and the inner demon knew that if Hell's army were allowed to charge into the ranks of Chiyou's forces, they would be like tigers rushing into a sheep's stable, instantly plunging the entirety of Chiyou's army into chaos and disarray!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even without that frantic cry from the inner demon, Resentment had already sensed that something was wrong, and he immediately charged forward with bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!\" His thunderous voice rang out across the entirety of Zhuolu as he roared, \"Anyone who retreats will be executed on the spot!\"</span></p>"

However, they were demonic deities who had fought against the mighty army of the Yellow Emperor, and not only were they not intimidated by the advance of Hell's army, their bloodlust and killing intent were stimulated instead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With Resentment leading the charge, the army let loose a collective roar, and in the next instant, the ground began to quake violently as hundreds of demonic deities charged forward in an unstoppable wave.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Retreat was not an option for either side.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this instant, Zhuolu had transformed into the most primitive and most brutal of arenas, and only one side could emerge alive!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The eruption of Yin energy transformed the two armies into a pair of gargantuan, inky-black asteroids that were crashing toward one another with all their might, trying to completely and utterly destroy the other at all cost. The killing intent radiating from the two armies was so fearsome that even the earth was groaning.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon looked on with an intense gaze at the back, having already pulled out the bloodstained boneshard, which it was massaging incessantly in a nervous manner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Something's not right!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It only took 40 seconds for all of the heavy cavalry units of Hell to reach their top speed, and directly opposing them was a stone mountain. Were they preparing to forcibly charge their way right through it?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The most important assets for heavy cavalry were speed and momentum, yet it appeared as if they were about to sacrifice all of that! Had they gone insane?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a gentle voice rang out across the entirety of Zhuolu, and the inner demon faltered slightly before immediately raising its head to try and find the source of the voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye had already risen up into the heavens, and the clouds of Yin energy released by the tens of thousands of heavy cavalry troops were churning incessantly. He stood like a bright moon above the river of darkness, and as his voice rang out, all of the Yin energy in all directions seemed to fall still before rapidly converging behind him!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sense of foreboding immediately welled up in the inner demon's heart upon seeing this. This was only its instinct, but it knew that it would be unwise not to trust this instinct. Thus, it should immediately issue words of caution to its allies, but how could it go about doing that?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the only being above the Yama-King level, the inner demon was the undisputed leader of this army. If it were to suddenly yell out for everyone to be careful, the entire army would immediately become extremely hesitant. Furthermore, they didn't even know where the danger was coming from!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the inner demon was hesitating about how to proceed, Qin Ye's robes were blown directly upward in mid-air as fierce Yin wind howled around him, forming a giant black hole behind him that was over 100 kilometers in radius!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless specks of netherfire were flashing frantically within the black hole, as if to heed the call of the ruler of Hell. At the same time, the talismans on the surface of an inky-black coffin near the skeletal wall spontaneously erupted into flame. The lid of the coffin was slowly lifted amid a burst of creaking and groaning, following which boundless Yin energy erupted out into the open.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Veins were bulging on Qin Ye's forehead as he drew a trail of blood along the blade of his sword with his fingers. His voice was also growing louder and louder, until his chanting resembled rumbling thunder.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was gritting its teeth tightly as it inspected its surroundings, and as Qin Ye's chanting grew louder and louder, the entire space began to rumble incessantly. This was a call made by the ruler of Hell in person, and it could be sensed across all three realms. In this instant, all of the paramount beings within the three realms turned their attention toward Zhuolu in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Within the short span of just 20 seconds, the incantation was completed, and an earth-shattering boom suddenly erupted out of the black hole of Yin energy behind Qin Ye. At the same time, the coffin lying behind the skeletal wall was finally completely opened.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The faint sound of crashing waves rang out across the entire sky, yet the two charging armies paid it no heed and continued to advance toward one another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From above, one would be able to see that the two armies were no more than two kilometers apart at this point.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The army of demonic ghostly immortals had already gotten into formation beside the stone mountain, and they were led by three Abyssal Prefects.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon didn't pay any heed to that. Its gaze had been focused on Qin Ye this entire time. From the moment that the sound of the waves had begun to ring, it had immediately sensed that something was wrong. As the sound of the crashing waves grew louder and louder, the sense of foreboding in its heart also became more and more pronounced.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was sure that it had heard this sound somewhere before, but it couldn't quite recall where.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, its expression abruptly stiffened, and it yelled without any hesitation, \"Retreat!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Resentment turned in mid-air toward the inner demon with a dumbstruck expression. The two armies hadn't even clashed yet, and retreating at a time like this definitely wasn't a wise decision.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, he gritted his teeth and pretended not to have heard the inner demon, then continued to charge directly toward Qin Ye as a wave of reddish-black Yin energy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the sound of the crashing waves crescendoed to a peak, and the enormous Yin energy vortex behind Qin Ye exploded violently, sending a massive body of Yin energy that was as viscous as water flooding out into the open!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if a massive dam had suddenly been broken, resulting in a ferocious flood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that instant, time seemed to have fallen completely still.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yin soldiers and demonic ghostly immortals suddenly discovered that they were unable to hear any sound. The Yin soldiers continued onward without pause, while all of the demonic ghostly immortals raised their heads in unison, staring at the vast waves of Yin energy crashing down from the heavens with incredulous expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the Yellow Springs!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right above the Yellow Springs was a majestic seal that was glowing as it hovered in mid-air. The nine dragons carved etched onto its surface seemed to sprung to life, releasing tiny pillars of water out of their mouths. However, these pillars of water expanded drastically as soon as they emerged, and by the time they reached the ground, they had already swelled to become enormous waterfalls!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That's King Yanluo's Seal!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon turned to Qin Ye with a stunned expression, realizing that it had underestimated Hell's determination to hunt it down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The waterfalls crashing down from the heavens and the heavy cavalry charging along the ground formed an inescapable wall of destruction, and the inner demon knew that if the army of demonic ghostly immortals were to be struck by the Yellow Springs, the outcome would be utterly catastrophic!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had already been stunned into silence. There was no way that the forces of the Nigu Division and the Xinglan Division could oppose the turbulent Yellow Springs, and all that it could hope for now was that they could retreat in time to escape the Yellow Springs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the sky above, Resentment was also completely rooted to the spot.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Having never participated in mass&nbsp;warfare, there was no way that he could've been prepared for this, and this was why Hell had the confidence and courage to launch an attack, even though the forces on both sides were evenly matched.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Having only recently been resurrected, there was no way that the inner demon's forces would possess any powerful artifacts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In addition to that, Hell had far more advanced weaponry at its disposal, thereby culminating in a significant advantage!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Retreat!\" Resentment looked on in horror at the oncoming Yellow Springs. He had no intention of experiencing the terrifying power imbued within the Yellow Springs for himself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Retreat!

They didn't know what was coming at them, but they knew that they couldn't ignore the overwhelming sense of peril that had welled up in their hearts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the tens of thousands of heavy cavalry were only 1,500 meters away from the stone mountain.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The flags of the 10 major branches of the army were raised in unison, resembling dragons and phoenixes spreading their wings and taking flight into the heavens!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!\" the entire army roared in unison, and their collective voices were like rumbling thunder rolling across the landscape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that this order was issued, the tens of thousands of heavy cavalry units sprang up in unison, forming a leaping black wave on the horizon. Even the demonic ghostly immortals and 73 immortals were heavily intimidated by this astonishing sight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The heavy cavalry units had formed an unbroken tidal wave that seemed to be capable of destroying all obstacles in their way, and that tidal wave was coming directly toward them!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They could even see the scorching netherfire burning beneath the visors of the heavy cavalry units charging at the forefront, as well as the light gleaming off their menacing spears.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, their astonishment didn't end there. As they continued to look on, all of the heavy cavalry units landed on the Yellow Springs instead of descending back down onto the ground. The Yellow Springs carried them higher and higher, making them resemble immortal&nbsp;warriors that had descended from the heavens, and the spears of all of the heavy cavalry units were aimed directly at them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yellow Springs were inundating Zhuolu!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of this all-conquering wave, all of the low-grade demonic ghostly immortals at the forefront could only look on in shock and horror.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In their mind, the stone mountain was their only salvation. Escape was already impossible, so the only thing that they could rely on to save them seemed to be this stone mountain.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, a doomsday-like scene ensued.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yellow Springs crashed violently into the stone mountain, sending massive splashes of inky-black water spraying in all directions. The water of the Yellow Springs fell from above like stars plummeting down from the sky, followed by the formidable heavy cavalry units.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The low-grade demonic ghostly immortals down below didn't even get a chance to cry out before they were completely inundated by the Yellow Springs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the ground began to tremble violently as countless spears and arrows were aimed directly toward Zhuolu. Resentment, Lust, Envy, Insanity, and the inner demon were all gathered together, exchanging silent glances with one another. They were so stunned that they had lost the ability to speak, and the only thing that they could see was the indomitable army of Hell carried by the waves of the Yellow Springs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They weren't in fear. Instead, they were humiliated!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a rematch of the most significant battle in Cathayan history. They had thought that the descendants of the Yellow Emperor wouldn't pose much obstacle to their revenge at all, and never did they think that they would be so completely and utterly crushed from the very outset of the battle!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if they were being told that this era no longer belonged to them, that the times had already left them far behind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long while, Lust finally recovered from her stunned stupor. Not only was she not disheartened at the sight of how formidable Hell was, she was brimming with killing intent. \"It looks like we really underestimated the descendants of the Yellow Emperor.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy turned toward the inner demon before asking, \"You said that you have a way to resurrect our king. Are you sure?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're still suspecting me even at a time like this?\" the inner demon scoffed. \"That was the first condition of the agreement that we signed, I wouldn't lie about something so important.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy nodded in response. \"Open the Myriad Soul Pagoda!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The other Yama-Kings immediately turned toward him upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy took a deep breath, then sighed, \"The times have changed...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The formidable display put on by Hell's army had crushed their pride and arrogance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"If we can't resurrect our king on this occasion, I don't think we'll ever get another chance. If we're unable to resurrect our king, then there's no reason for us to continue to exist. We should've disappeared into history long ago, and I would be too ashamed to continue living if we're defeated once again by the descendants of the Yellow Emperor.\"</span></p>"

Qin Ye picked up his teacup, but didn't drink from it, and not only did he not appear to be more relaxed, his brows were furrowed even tighter than before.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The atmosphere was very tense and gloomy, and Zhao Yun decided to try and lighten the mood. \"Your Excellency, you made the right decision. There's no way that the inner demon could've anticipated that the tomb of Lishan Laomu would suddenly open, and that the Southern Purple Palace Array would seal the entire city. There must be some useful leads in the ruins of those construction sites.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye shook his head in response. It was clear that Zhao Yun was just trying to console him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With Yuncheng split up into two, the inner demon had definitely claimed the most advantageous side for itself, while the side that Qin Ye and the others were on was the one that the inner demon had abandoned.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Whose remains could they be?\" he suddenly said as he looked into Zhao Yun's eyes with a grim expression. \"This is the key to solving this mystery.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He revealed his theory to Zhao Yun, including his suspected involvement of the extraterrestrial gods, then said, \"There were over 1,000 ancient corpses buried here, and their bodies were destroyed, but not their souls. Over the past several thousand years, some of them have already become Yama-Kings. This indicates that an extremely fearsome battle must've taken place in Yuncheng in the past, and these corpses were all left behind from that battle. Who could they be?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun pursed his lips, and only after a long while did he heave a faint sigh. \"That's what I'm perplexed about as well. There are only several instances in the historical records detailing large outbreaks of powerful evil ghosts, some of which have even included Abyssal Prefects and Yama-Kings, but none of those instances took place anywhere near Yuncheng! The battle between the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou took place in Hebei Province, so if there are remains, that should be where they're found.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as he was about to continue, Qin Ye suddenly interjected, \"The bone shard that the inner demon brought out belonged to a being of fortune and faith, but perhaps there were more of them than just the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou. Perhaps Emperor Guangwu of Han, Liu Xiu, could also count as one?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I don't think so,\" Zhao Yun replied with a shake of his head. \"At the very most, Liu Xiu only extended the bloodline of a dynasty and created an ethnic group, which is still far from enough from making him worthy of being referred to as a being of fortune and faith. From my knowledge, the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou were the only two beings worthy of that title, and whoever came out on top between them would be the pioneer of the new era.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that case, it could only be Chiyou.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the battle between the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou took place in Hebei, which was far away from Yuncheng! Furthermore, according to historical records, after Chiyou was slain, his head and body relentlessly tried to join back together again, and that was why the Yellow Emperor used longmas to separate the two parts of his body, ensuring that they would never meet again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence descended upon the tent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, Zhao Yun said, \"Perhaps we should ask Lishan Laomu directly.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes immediately lit up upon hearing this, but then quickly dimmed once again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was indeed the best way to proceed. Now that Chiyou's remains had resurfaced, perhaps Heaven would make an exception, and Qin Ye was prepared to visit the retirement home that Lishan Laomo was staying in, but there wasn't enough time!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Southern Purple Palace Array will only last four days,\" he sighed with a shake of his head.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Perhaps there's another way...\" A contemplative look appeared on Zhao Yun's face as he said, \"Your Excellency, interaction between Heaven and the underworld is impossible due to the fact that the mortal realm is sandwiched between them. However, that doesn't mean that we won't be able to communicate with Heaven. In the past, Ksitigarbha has visited the underworld, even though that was only a projection. I've only just thought of this, but there are two ways for Heaven to interact with the underworld, the first of which would be through a projection like the one used by Ksitigarbha. That can only be initiated by someone in Heaven, so we're unable to make it happen. The second way would be to find something closely related to the one you want to get into contact with, then use the Heavenly Inquiry art!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes lit up once again, only to dim again a few seconds later.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was indeed a good idea, but they needed something extremely closely related to Lishan Laomu, and he didn't have that!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was indeed the tomb of Lishan Laomu, but it was only something erected by her descendants to commemorate her!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps Lishan Laomu had pointed out this city to be the place of her origin, but she wouldn't have left behind anything related to her here. Even though she had set up an array here, arrays were formed by runes, so it couldn't be counted as an item.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lishan Laomu could perhaps project herself here if she wished to do so, but Qin Ye didn't have anything through which he could directly contact Lishan Laomu using Heavenly Inquiry.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun also realized this shortly thereafter, and he heaved a forlorn sigh. \"It seems that fate is stacked against us.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's alright.\" Qin Ye quickly recovered from his disappointment, then rose to his feet as he said in a cold voice, \"If we can't think of anything, then we'll just have to make something happen through our actions.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just as Zhao Yun had said, there was no way that the inner demon would've anticipated the opening of the tomb of Lishan Laomu. The skeletal wall allowed the inner demon to keep the most advantageous side of the city to itself, but even though this part of the city was no longer useful to it, there had to be many leads left behind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun rose to his feet before cupping his fist in a solemn salute. \"Be careful, Your Excellency.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had a feeling that whatever was buried under this city was more terrifying than they could imagine!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A stone pillar was shattered by a vicious punch, and Envy's face was twisted with fury as he turned to the inner demon with tightly gritted teeth. \"So this was your plan? You've trapped all of us here! What do we do now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The four Yama-Kings had surrounded the inner demon, and outside of them were countless evil ghosts, including several Abyssal Prefects, the 73 immortals, and several hundred Anitya Hellguards and Soul Hunters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one could've anticipated that there was such a massive number of evil ghosts buried beneath Yuncheng.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon didn't say anything, and before it could speak, the muscular man said, \"If you didn't promise us that you could resurrect our king, there's no way we would've decided to ally ourselves with you! I told you to leave this place, but you insisted on staying, and we're all trapped here now!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you doubting me?\" The inner demon asked in a cold voice. It was still using Bai Liangping's body as it said, \"Don't forget who was the one that dug all of you up from underground!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Its Yin energy swept through the entire area, and under its immense pressure, none of the evil ghosts present were able to say anything. Bai Liangping swept a cold gaze around him as he said in a frosty voice, \"If it isn't for me, you would still be buried right now! If your king were here, he would have the right to speak to me as equals, but who do you think you are?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice was like rumbling thunder, and in response to it, the 73 immortals slowly opened their eyes, making no attempt to conceal their Yin energy as they slowly hovered up into the sky like 73 black suns.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Deathly silence ensued.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Menacing Yin energy was surging incessantly, and pairs of crimson eyes that looked as if they belonged to a pack of fierce wolves emerged in the surrounding area. Envy's hands balled up into tight fists as a bloodthirsty smile appeared on his face, and his inky-black nails were drawing blood from his own palms, but he paid that no heed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right beside him, Resentment, who had possessed a short and chubby elderly man, slowly raised his hands, and a series of white bone spikes had already pierced through his clothes as they extended out of his body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon leaned forward slightly as a menacing smile appeared on his face. \"What? You feel insulted? Do you think this is several thousand years ago, back when you were still the rulers of the human race? Are you enraged that even someone like me would dare to speak to you like this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His Yin energy surged through the area like a tsunami, transforming the entire place into an inky-black abyss as he continued, \"Why don't you try me then? If you really dare to attack me, I'll send you all back to hell in seconds!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The atmosphere was extremely tense, and it seemed that a physical altercation was inevitable.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the oppressive silence, Resentment suddenly smiled, and in the next instant, his arm elongated to over 10 meters in length, spearing directly toward the inner demon's chest like lightning!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The attack was so fast that only a faint shadow could be seen flying through the air, and the anguished howls of vengeful spirits rang out in all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of this rapid attack, the inner demon was completely unimpressed, and a derisive smirk appeared on his face. However, before he even had a chance to retaliate, a wave of inky-black hair erupted from behind Resentment like a den of countless snakes, wrapping around Resentment's arm and stopping it cold in its tracks!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, Resentment's hand was no more than a foot away from the inner demon, yet Bai Liangping's chest, which had been normal and whole just a moment ago, had already transformed into a mouth that was gaped wide open! Within it were several dozen tentacles and rows upon rows of sharp, scalpel-like fangs, just waiting for Resentment's hand to enter.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What are you doing, Lust?\" Resentment slowly turned around.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A woman wearing a dirty white dress had appeared behind them out of the blue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her feet were bare, and her dress was originally a pristine white color, but it was grimy and stained with blotches of blood. Her long, black hair draped down around her face like dead seaweed, and through her hair, one could only see a single crimson eye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Having an altercation here isn't going to help anything,\" Lust said, and her voice was as cringe-inducing as the sound of metal scraping over a blackboard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her body remained completely still, yet her head was turning toward the inner demon like the head of a broken doll.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I have one question for you: will you still be able to fulfill your agreement with us?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I can't offer you any guarantees, but I assure you that I have no intention of dying here,\" the inner demon replied.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I see.\" Lust nodded in response. \"What do you plan to do now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm going to Fenglingdu!\" the inner demon replied without any hesitation. \"They won't be able to bypass the Thousand Tribulation Walls. Even if they manage to do that, all I have to do is bury the remains of your king at Fenglingdu, and that'll be enough for us to weather this storm.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy's eyes narrowed slightly upon hearing this. \"You're going to activate the Myriad Soul Pagoda? That wasn't part of our agreement! The Myriad Soul Pagoda is the last thing we can count on for the return of our king. If you activate it, but we fail on this occasion, we'll have to wait for countless years for the next opportunity!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on the inner demon's face as it said, \"The Myriad Soul Pagoda will only be a last resort. If I recall correctly, the Southern Purple Palace Array will only be able to last for four days before it dissipates. During that time, they won't even be able to bypass the Thousand Tribulation Walls! Even if they somehow manage to bypass that and force me to activate the Myriad Soul Pagoda, there's no way they'll be able to set foot into the pagoda. By the time four days pass by, my reinforcements will already be waiting outside the array!\"</span></p>"

Inside the tent were the four Yama-Kings and all of the high-ranking officials of the Yuncheng municipal government and the local Special Investigations Department branch.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, all of the forces had already been gathered, and the army had swelled to a total of over 630,000 troops.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entirety of Yuncheng was filled with specks of netherfire that were even more dazzling than the stars in the sky, presenting a scene that was akin to the outer space of the underworld. It was both magnificent and menacing, and it struck the beholder with a sense of asphyxiation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside the tent, the tension in the air was virtually palpable. A series of netherfire candles were flickering incessantly, casting wavering shadows across the entire tent, and a constant stream of underworld emissaries were entering and exiting the tent, presenting different files that they stacked onto the table in front of Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Starting from the previous night, 1,700 scouting groups had entered the bottomless holes, then returned at 12 AM. After taking three hours to compile all of the gathered data, all of the information had been placed into these files, which had, in turn, been presented to everyone in the tent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mayor Bai of Yuncheng had disappeared, so the municipal party committee secretary was attending the meeting in his stead. With each page that he read, the more terrified he became, and by the time he had finished reading the compiled information, his clothes were already drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one could've imagined that there would be so many evil ghosts buried under Yuncheng! Essentially, they had been living above a massive evil ghost tomb for thousands of years!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had no right to speak here. Given the power of the mortal realm, the most they could do was assist Hell. They had only just been presented with this information, while the commanders of the Yin soldiers present had already completed an analysis of power between the two sides, and the results of that analysis were far from optimistic.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the largest and final opposing force, yet the enemy forces were extremely powerful. In total, they had 1,656 Anitya Hellguards, 24 Infernal Judges, six Abyssal Prefects, and four Yama-Kings!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Could they really win this battle?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One uneasy pair of eyes after another was directed toward Qin Ye, who was sitting on the main seat in the camp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to the unease that everyone was feeling, all of the commanders had fallen silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the third time in the history of the new Hell that their King Yanluo was leading Hell's troops into battle. The first occasion was the Battle of Ashmound, while the second occasion had the war of unification.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The new administration of Hell had already created countless miracles in the past, but was this hurdle going to prove to be too difficult to overcome?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the silence, Qin Ye tapped his table to draw everyone's attention, then said, \"Now that everyone has had a chance to look at the data, I'm sure you all have an idea of the situation that we're facing. While the bottomless holes have been investigated, the Reincarnation King has already brought back some blight vermin. Thankfully, there was still a small batch left.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slowly rose to his feet, and his Yin energy seeped through the tent around him. All of the preparations were complete, and it was time to begin the final battle!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice was very calm, as if he were describing something completely mundane, and he declared, \"At 5 AM tomorrow, a total of 700 blight vermin will break through the skeletal wall for us. An hour after that, our entire army will advance toward Zhuolu. This is an unavoidable battle!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He swept a fiery gaze across everyone present as he continued, \"The fate of humanity and the world rests on the outcome of this battle! As descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we have no excuse, nor any right to avoid this battle! I'll be counting on you, everyone.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some battles had to be fought, even though they were clearly going to be extremely difficult from the outset.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The enemy was more formidable than anything Hell had ever faced, but backing down was not an option. As was the case with all turning points in history, someone had to step up and make the difficult decision, one that could even be considered to be a little deranged.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Failure would spell catastrophe, while victory would ensure the future.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Through his words, Qin Ye was expressing his determination to everyone, and all of the commanders reflexively sat up a little straighter as the concern and unease in their eyes turned into calmness and resilience.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The worst that could happen to them was death.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had lost their chance to be heroes as humans, but they certainly weren't going to be remembered as cowards in the afterlife!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a wave of Qin Ye's hand, four badges appeared in mid-air. His gaze swept over the faces of all of the commanders present as he gently picked up one of the badges, then injected his Yin energy into it, upon which the image of Envy appeared on its surface.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He took a deep breath, then asked in a voice that was brimming with killing intent, \"Who wishes to step up and slay Envy of the four ominous stars?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"East Conquering General Gao Mingquan wishes to offer his services!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Border Guardian General Xu Zi'an wishes to offer his services!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"West Vanquishing General Su Wei wishes to offer his services!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"East Vanquishing General Fang Changqing wishes to offer his services!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, several generals stepped forward at once, yet they were all forced back into their seats by a gust of Yin wind, following which a figure made its way to the center of the tent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Sit back down, this is not an opponent that you can deal with.\" Arthis turned to Qin Ye with a serious expression, then cupped her fist in a salute and extended a deep bow as she said, \"Warden of the six paths of reincarnation and Reincarnation King Arthis wishes to offer her services!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you sure?\" Qin Ye asked with a serious expression. This was not the time to be messing around.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arthis stood up straight as she declared, \"Hell has never feared nor bowed its head to anyone! Are we scared just because our enemies are powerful? These demonic scoundrels must be slain for their transgressions against the Cathayan Underworld! So long as I still exist, I will make sure to tie Envy down with every fiber of my being! Even if I am to die, I will drag him into the cycle of reincarnation with me!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't waste any more time with words, and one of the badges flew into Arthis's grasp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arthis accepted the badge as she cupped her fist in a salute, following which Qin Ye picked up the second badge. \"Who wishes to step up and slay Lust of the four ominous stars?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before anyone else had a chance to say anything, the Harken had already stepped forward. \"I'll be taking Lust's head.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though the Harken was quite diminutive in stature, the entire city of Yuncheng seemed to be trembling with each step that it took, and its fearsome power as a divine beast of Hell was not to be looked down on.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you confident in your chances?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So long as I still live, Lust won't be going anywhere!\" the Harken declared with implacable confidence. \"After this battle, no one would dare to challenge Hell's authority ever again!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that, the Harken took another one of the remaining three badges.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With only two badges left, Qin Ye was a little hesitant about how to proceed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He and Zhao Yun both had to face the inner demon together. On a one-on-one basis, neither of them would be a match for the inner demon, particularly considering the fact that Zhao Yun didn't possess the origin runes of emotions and desires. In this battle, slaying the inner demon was the key, but it seemed like they were lacking the high-end power to deal with both the inner demon and all of its other powerful allies.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though the four ominous stars weren't necessarily close allies of the inner demon, in the face of a common enemy, they would definitely set aside any internal conflict that they had in order to oppose Hell together. If he and Zhao Yun were to face the inner demon, who would oppose Resentment and Insanity?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Additionally, the 73 immortals had to be accounted for as well. In a large-scale battle like this, allowing the enemy's powerful beings to do as they pleased was no different from suicide.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a voice rang out at the entrance of the tent. \"Yanluo Qin, may I be worthy of offering my services?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye immediately cast his gaze toward the entrance, and the curtain was pulled aside to reveal a group of figures.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The tent was quite a large one, so the entrance was also quite wide, and from Qin Ye's position, he could clearly see Qin Changxin, Qin Xinzhong, Murai Sadakatsu, Mori Ranmaru, and others standing outside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It could be said that all of the aides that Oda Nobunaga had taken from the Obsidian Heaven’s Eye Bowl were gathered here, and behind them were several dozen men wearing black ninja attire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind those ninjas was a group consisting of over 1,000 people. They were once elite Yin soldiers who answered directly to Qin Ye, and at the center of the three groups was an inky-black coffin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The coffin was sealed shut with chains and talismans, but even so, wisps of dark Yin energy were still slowly seeping out of it, swirling around the coffin like mist. Upon sensing this Yin energy, all of the underworld emissaries present faltered slightly, then turned toward the four Yama-Kings in unison with incredulous expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never did they think that they would see something so powerful and regal on an occasion like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before anyone had a chance to say anything, Arthis's voice rang out like rumbling thunder, reaching the ears of every underworld emissary in Yuncheng. \"Our backs are truly against the wall here, everyone.

If we die, you won't survive, either.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's why I agree to your unreasonable request,\" the inner demon replied with a smile. \"I didn't think that the renowned army of Chiyou would be reduced to such a pitiful state after only the opening exchange.

However, the inner demon remained completely unharmed, and its Yin energy formed a series of tiny vortexes that slowly pushed Lust's hair out of its body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I need an hour of preparation time.

However, the difference between them was the thousands of years of experience that Hell had over Chiyou's forces. It was this advantage that had allowed them to crush the army of demonic ghostly immortals from the outset of the battle.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Having secured such a significant advantage, Hell's army certainly wasn't going to relent!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the heavy cavalry units raised their spears, and the sound of thundering war drums and melodious long horns rang out from behind them.

The demonic ghostly immortals could only look on with tightly gritted teeth as the black wave closing in on them was reflected in the netherfire in their eyes. The extreme sense of peril in their hearts instantly caused their adrenalin to spike through the roof!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even Envy and all of the other Yama-Kings had been stunned into silence upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After several thousand years of development, warfare had already become something that they were completely unfamiliar with...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire army was like a well-oiled machine, a single, unified entity.

Even Envy could feel his own skin crawling, and his body was trembling in sync with the earth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the heavy cavalry units of Hell were only 300 meters away, and they had formed an impenetrable and inescapable wave of destruction as their armor and weapons gleamed under the light of the dawn sun.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, Envy abruptly swung his arm downward and ordered, \"Charge!\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if a pack of ferocious beasts had been released from their cage, and over 1,000 different types of demons and evil ghosts were sent charging toward the heavy cavalry units, while reddish-black Yin energy swelled into a formidable wave.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of the 73 immortals in the form of an elderly woman slowly drifted forward.

There was a hideous smile on her face as she rushed toward the heavy cavalry units charging at the forefront.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As she advanced, her body swelled in size, and after crossing over around a dozen meters, her body had also risen to roughly a dozen meters in height. At the same time, all of her wrinkles were smoothed out due to the expansion of her body, transforming her into a young and beautiful woman.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two sides were drawing closer and closer, and their eyes were focused solely on one another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The woman roared as she accelerated even further, and several dozen arms abruptly emerged from her back before thrusting forward with violent force.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several underworld emissaries were swatted back amid muffled groans, but to the woman's surprise, the wave of heavy cavalry units didn't stop.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They only had one objective, which was to advance and strike deep into the heart of the enemy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The heavy cavalry units were connected by countless chains, so the impact of the woman's attack was spread throughout all of the heavy cavalry units. At the same time, countless spears plunged into her body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She raised her head and let loose an agonized screech, following which the nails on her hands abruptly elongated to over a meter in length before being viciously swept forward.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On this occasion, she was targeting the Yin soldiers on the skeletal horses.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several Yin soldiers were instantly reduced to netherfire before they even had a chance to cry out, but the woman still felt as if something weren't quite right.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why was it that her attacks were only able to kill four or five of these basic Yin soldiers at a time?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you confused?\" Right at this moment, a voice rang out beside her ear amid a gust of wind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The woman reflexively lashed out toward the direction the voice had come from, yet her attack landed on nothing but empty air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A longsword had already plunged into the back of her neck, following which Yin energy erupted violently like a wave, and the excruciating pain immediately caused her to cry out in agony.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Something's not right!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Another gust of wind swept past, and the woman gritted her teeth tightly as she repressed the pain with all her might while lashing out once again with three of her arms.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, in the instant that she reached out toward her assailant, her three arms were severed at once!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who's there?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An overwhelming sense of horror welled up in her heart, and she frantically retreated, but the gust of Yin wind stuck to her like glue, revolving around her incessantly. Within the span of less than 20 seconds, all of her arms had been severed, and she was completely rooted to the spot as she looked on in shock and horror.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Up to this point, she hadn't even caught a clear glimpse of her assailant!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yin soldiers may be weak and insignificant on their own, but when enhanced by a military formation of the highest caliber and Yanluo Qin's Judgment Pen, several thousand Yin soldiers would be capable of killing an Infernal Judge.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The woman's head turned around 180 degrees in a mechanical manner, and her expression had become completely twisted.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of gashes appeared all over her body as she spat through gritted teeth, \"Who are you?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of a sword being returned to its scabbard rang out, and a man who was wearing the same armor as all of the heavy cavalry units turned around to face the woman's indignant gaze.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was a slightly short and portly figure, and his face was concealed behind a visor. \"I am Han Qinhu.

Thus, aside from the seven Abyssal Prefects, all of the other Infernal Judges and Anitya Hellguards had rushed toward the oncoming wave of destruction along with the demonic ghostly immortals.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What they had failed to anticipate was that the 73 immortals would be crushed so quickly and comprehensively!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For the army of demonic ghostly immortals, the loss of the 73 immortals wouldn't be a significant one.

Such a brilliant opportunity would only come once. None of his subordinates had informed him of this plan, but they were able to execute it to perfection with a combination of experience, courage, and determination.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The attack had come far too abruptly, and it was traveling far too quickly.

Within the vast vortex, a giant golden eye suddenly appeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was like a sun that had risen in the night, and in the instant that it appeared, an oppressive atmosphere settled over the entire battlefield. Everyone on the battlefield could only look up helplessly at the gigantic eye in the sky, feeling extremely tiny and insignificant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"To think that I was tricked by mere ants...

Bursts of scarlet Yin energy erupted into the heavens from those trenches, fusing together perfectly with the countless dazzling eyes in the sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An earth-shattering boom rang out as all of the Yin clouds exploded violently, and in the next instant, all of the underworld emissaries and demonic ghostly immortals drew a sharp breath in unison as they looked up at the sky with astonished expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were greeted by the sight of a giant butterfly that appeared to be around 50 kilometers in size, roughly comparable with the size of the entirety of Zhuolu!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The butterfly was hovering amid the Yin energy up above, looking like a deity that had descended from the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, it wasn't strictly a true butterfly. Its head was more like that of a dragonfly, with a gaping hole at the center, within which was a giant golden eye. On either side of the head was a pair of deer antlers, and they were astonishing in size, winding upward to form a crown that was several kilometers in stature!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, its wings didn't belong to a butterfly, either. Instead, they were like phoenix wings that were completely formed by crimson flames, with clear signs of feathers visible within.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Its entire body was covered in inky-black fur that resembled mountains and valleys, gently swaying in the fierce wind. Its body was also riddled with irregular eyes that were around 10 meters in size each, making for a terrifying monster that would only appear in one's worst nightmares.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is the inner demon's true form...\" Zhao Yun murmured after taking a deep breath. \"Whatever you did, it looks like you've truly enraged it.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon spread its wings like a god of creation, and bursts of rainbow light fell from its wings like rain. In the blink of an eye, the countless beams of rainbow light had vanished into the bodies of all of the Yin soldiers on the battlefield.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Han Qinhu was in the process of fleeing the scene, and he immediately raised his shield, but the light passed through everything without encountering any impediment before vanishing into his forehead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a breathtakingly beautiful scene to behold, but it was also one that was fraught with lethal peril. The spiritual body of the inner demon was impossibly massive, virtually concealing the entire heavens, and its voice was like rumbling thunder as it declared, \"No one's heart is devoid of weaknesses. Yanluo Qin, you have truly enraged me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">You have no right to oppose me!

He wanted to resist it, but found himself completely unable to do so! He had to vent this fury and violence, and the urge was just as instinctive as that of drinking, eating, and breathing!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He drew his sword in one swift motion, then stabbed it directly toward Wang Meng with bloodshot eyes, only to be met with a spear strike from Wang Meng at the same time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They weren't the only ones overcome by this irrepressible sense of violence. In the blink of an eye, all of the Yin soldiers on the battlefield seemed to have gone insane, picking up their weapons and attacking their comrades. Their orderly formation instantly collapsed, and within the span of just several seconds, thousands of specks of netherfire had already risen up into the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the four Yama-Kings on the inner demon's side exchanged a glance with one another before immediately turning around and rushing back toward the center of Zhuolu without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the demonic ghostly immortals also followed them in their retreat, and at this point, the ground was no longer cracking any further.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy's teeth were tightly gritted as he internally cursed the two Abyssal Prefects for their clear failure to protect the inner demon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, the entire battlefield pulsed slightly like a heartbeat, but none of the frenzied Yin soldiers on the battlefield detected this slight tremor.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Myriad Soul Pagoda has been activated!\" Resentment was frantically rushing toward Zhuolu as quickly as he could. \"It's still not the right time yet! No one knows what's going to happen if the Myriad Soul Pagoda is activated too early! What do we do now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He cast his gaze toward the center of Zhuolu with tightly furrowed brows, and there, a series of small mounds had already begun to emerge on the landscape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The tops of the mounds were cracking and collapsing incessantly, as if there were a powerful giant beneath the surface.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy was silent for a moment before replying, \"We have no other options. The Many-faced God is stalling for time for our sake, all we can do is get back as quickly as possible.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a pure white ripple swept over the entire battlefield in the blink of an eye. It was like a wave of soothing comfort, and all of the raised weapons were instantly lowered again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What just happened to me?\" Wang Meng's soul was trembling as he laid a hand over his own chest with a hint of lingering fear in his eyes. The power of the inner demon was like an all-incinerating blaze, yet the white ripple was like an almighty flood that had drowned out the fire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What was I doing just now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What happened?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why was I about to attack you?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yin soldiers exchanged one astonished glance after another, then turned around collectively toward the rear of Hell's army.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was standing there with a giant rune behind him. The rune was constantly changing in form, and it was releasing one wave of white light after another. Amid the white radiance, even the most violent of tendencies and most powerful of desires were soothed and quelled.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's the origin rune of emotions and desires!\" the inner demon exclaimed as it cast a stunned gaze toward Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the astonishment on its face quickly faded, and all of its eyes fell shut as pillars of dazzling golden light descended behind it. At the same time, it slowly rose up into the air like an ascending deity. \"I must say, this is quite unexpected, but you're already too late to stop me. Come... Come to the arena of millennia past, the place where this civilization began! We'll be waiting for you!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Its voice was like rumbling thunder, but it garnered no reply.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yin energy in Zhao Yun's entire body was swelling rapidly as he made a grabbing motion, upon which his Courage of Dragons Silver Spear fell into his grasp. His Yin energy had formed a vast vortex beside him, and it was releasing fierce wind that caused his suit of silver armor to clink incessantly. At the same time, Arakshasa, the Harken, and Qin Ye also released their Yin energy into the heavens while inspecting their surroundings with wary expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An ancient, ruthless aura was slowly seeping over the entire battlefield, and it was growing more and more pronounced. Meanwhile, the earth began to tremble, and the tremors were also becoming more and more violent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon had only been stalling for time just now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This aura was so apparent that even the Yin soldiers on the battlefield could clearly sense it, and in response, they instinctively formed a series of groups in an attempt to seek safety in numbers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, an earth-shattering boom rang out, and the entirety of Zhuolu completely collapsed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless giant rocks were sent tumbling down as a gargantuan pagoda rose up toward the heavens.</span></p>"

Tied beneath several human skulls was a tattered piece of beast hide, upon which was inscribed some type of crimson text, and the skulls that were swaying in the wind seemed to be cackling in silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What on earth is this place...\" Guo Ziyi took a few steps backward with an astonished look on his face. This building was far more ancient than anything even during his lifetime!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Resentment grabbed onto the inner demon's collar, then gave it an enraged tug as he glowered into the inner demon's eyes with a furious expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was still using Bai Liangping's body, even though the body was as broken as a rag doll. Many sections of bone, flesh, and tendons had already been exposed beneath the skin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why did you do this?!\" Resentment roared in an enraged voice as Yin energy surged out of all of his orifices. \"Why has the Myriad Soul Pagoda been activated early? How many times have we told you that these are the only remains left behind by our king! Unless we restore them to their perfect state, the Myriad Soul Pagoda won't be able to provide us with any protection!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon's body was gently spasming, and its head had been twisted to an impossible angle. Its facial features were completely inhuman, and only the constantly moving eyeballs in its sockets indicated that it was alive.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Resentment had a chance to say anything further, a deathly white hand had already grabbed onto his mouth. The hand didn't appear to be exerting any force at all, but Resentment's skull was creaking audibly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Shut up,\" the inner demon said in a completely emotionless voice, then dragged its broken body slowly to the edge of this level before casting its gaze in Qin Ye's direction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Hell is regrouping right as we speak, so why are you not attacking now? What are you waiting for?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yama-Kings present were looking at the inner demon with suspicious eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was ridiculous to them that a group of Infernal Judges could've bypassed a being above the Yama-King level to launch a successful attack on Chiyou's remains. The situation had deteriorated to a point where there really wasn't much else that could go wrong.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, Lust's ghastly voice rang out from behind the inner demon. \"You promised us that you would help us resurrect our king, and it's time for you to follow through on that promise!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon turned to her with a stunned expression. \"Now? You're going to bring that up now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was still no response.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the four Yama-Kings had already silently surrounded the inner demon, and their answer was very apparent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the inner demon couldn't fulfill its promise, then there was no point for them to continue in this battle.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An alliance like theirs would completely fall apart if the agreement that the alliance was built upon were to be revoked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The 73 immortals that served as the inner demon's subordinates had virtually been completely wiped out, and in the wake of that, the power balance between the inner demon and Chiyou's remnant forces was already slowly shifting toward parity.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was exactly because of this that there was no clear leader in this group, thereby leading to the potential for a conflict.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, vast Yin energy erupted out of the inner demon's body, and in the next instant, its appearance began to rapidly change, as if it were going back in time to search through all of the humans it had possessed in the past.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on its face as it said, \"Choosing to work with you lot was the most idiotic decision of my life. So be it, let me show you my trump card!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of a long horn rang out, and the flags of Hell's army were flapping in the wind as Yin soldiers converged toward the Myriad Soul Pagoda from all directions. The sudden emergence of the Myriad Soul Pagoda had completely shattered their formation, but they were quickly rallying.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As for Chiyou's forces, it was unclear why they weren't doing anything, but their inactivity granted both sides a brief period of peace. However, everyone could sense that this was only the calm before the storm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was most definitely not the end. Instead, both sides were waiting for the opportunity to pounce at the enemy's throat!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind Hell's army, Qin Ye was holding the Judgment Pen and the Book of Life and Death, and the Yin energy of Hell's four Yama-Kings had already been released to encompass the Myriad Soul Pagoda in preparation for a counterattack. However, the inner demon and Chiyou's forces weren't doing anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What are they doing?\" Qin Ye mused. \"How could they pass up an opportunity like this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Harken shook its head in response. It was also unable to comprehend why the enemy wasn't attacking. If the four enemy Yama-Kings and all of their troops were to strike at a time like this, Hell's army would definitely suffer severe casualties.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, they hadn't done that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was on the constant lookout for an enemy attack while also quickly analyzing the Myriad Soul Pagoda. Even though he didn't know what era this building was from, he could still sense the domineering aura that it was giving off. It was like the sun in the sky, inspiring awe and veneration from all of its beholders.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, this sun was broken.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a massive slope on the western side of the pagoda, as if that part of the pagoda had been sliced off by a sword, and the slope was so massive that an army of 10,000 troops could charge through it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Nothingness hasn't appeared. They said that They would help us break through the Myriad Soul Pagoda's defenses when it appeared, but the Myriad Soul Pagoda has no defenses at the moment,\" Qin Ye murmured to himself. \"In that case, has that promise been postponed or revoked altogether?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a very important distinction between the two. If the Heavenly Dao had only postponed the fulfillment of Their promise, then They would still step in when necessary. However, it was definitely unwise to pin one's hopes on an emotionless machine like the Heavenly Dao.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the Harken's nose twitched slightly as it cast a perplexed gaze toward the Myriad Soul Pagoda. \"I'm catching a really strong scent of blood.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as its voice trailed off, streams of blood began to slowly flow down from the top level of the Myriad Soul Pagoda. They were like a series of bloody waterfalls, slowly draping a red coat over the entire pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Are they finally about to attack?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone remained silent as they stared intently at the top of the pagoda. A Yama-King could easily inspect an entire nation with a single glance, so it was an easy feat for them to inspect the top of the pagoda, particularly when it had no defenses.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The damage sustained by the pagoda and its lack of defenses could all be attributed to that surprise attack from Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inky-black Yin energy was revolving around the top of the Myriad Soul Pagoda, and QIn Ye could just barely make out the inner demon standing there. Its face was rapidly changing in appearance, and its attire was also quickly transitioning back through the eras. In less than a minute, it had gone back to the era of grass and beast hide garments.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, it withdrew all of its Yin energy, revealing a figure that was completely different in appearance to Bai Liangping. Instead, it was a man with a head of disheveled hair, wearing a beast hide garment and holding a whip in his hand.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The whip was very crude, woven from soft tree bark.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sense of foreboding suddenly welled up in Qin Ye's heart without any warning, as if something terrible were about to happen. At the same time, the inner demon raised its hands and began to chant something.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was clearly nothing happening, yet Qin Ye's heartbeat was rapidly accelerating.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He looked down at the assembling army down below, then asked, \"How much longer will they take?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"At least 20 more minutes,\" Zhao Yun replied. \"Even with the losses suffered thus far, the army still has a total of at least 400,000 troops, and that's not even taking the Asura Legion and the Hungry Ghost legion into account.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The larger the army, the longer it would take to organize.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Can the process be sped up somehow?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm afraid that would be very difficult... What's wrong, Your Excellency?\" Zhao Yun could sense that Qin Ye was growing rather agitated.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye shook his head in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He looked up at the inner demon, who was still chanting, then down at the troops gathering beneath his feet. More and more troops were flocking to the area, but he wasn't feeling any sense of security at all. Instead, the sense of foreboding in his heart was only growing more and more pronounced!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the ground suddenly trembled slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, the sound of horse hooves began to approach from the distance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye felt as if the sound were resonating directly in his heart, and it wasn't coming from the ground. Instead...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye abruptly raised his head to look up at the sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of the horse hooves was coming from the heavens!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">We can't keep waiting!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He immediately turned to Zhao Yun as he said, \"Brother Zhao, stop him!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun didn't ask why. Instead, his body abruptly transformed into a gust of Yin wind that swept directly toward the top of the pagoda. Right at this moment, the inner demon finally turned toward Qin Ye, and their eyes met.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No words were exchanged between them, but the tension in the air was palpable.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on the inner demon's face, and all of a sudden, the muscles on its arms bulged dramatically!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a thunderous roar, the sound of horse hooves drew to an abrupt halt, and a white horse that was over 20 meters tall was pulled out of thin air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">To be accurate, this creature couldn't be referred to as a horse. Its body was covered in golden scales, and there was a pair of deer antlers on its head, while a white mane extended all the way from its head to its tail. Furthermore, there was a head that was around five meters in size tied to its tail!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the longma that was carrying Chiyou's head!</span></p>"

He wanted to move, but found himself unable to keep up, and all he could do was instinctively fold his arms in front of himself as a shield, while the karmic fire around him formed a protective cocoon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he knew full well that this wouldn't be enough to save him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The oncoming attack was causing his eardrums to tremble violently, and deep trenches had been plowed into the ground in its wake. This was definitely not an attack that an Infernal Judge could withstand!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Am I going to die here?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as this thought sprang into his mind, a burst of Yin energy that was equally as fearsome knocked him aside violently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was sent flying back like a cannonball, but he paid no heed to his own injuries as he immediately raised his head and cast his gaze forward with an intense look in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a result, he was able to see that the Yin energy that had just erased over 100 heavy cavalry units out of existence had come from a stone, one that was only around the size of a thumb!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">We're being attacked by a Yama-King!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An overwhelming sense of peril instantly pierced directly into his mind, and he sprang to his feet without any hesitation. \"Retreat!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of thundering hooves quickly rang out as one row of heavy cavalry units after another retreated in unison. As soon as they regained their footing, tens of thousands of spear-wielding soldiers positioned themselves in front of the heavy cavalry units, using their giant shields to form a defensive wall. Behind the heavy cavalry units, tens of thousands of flaming arrows flew up into the sky, resembling dazzling stars in the night.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Yu habitually raised a hand to wipe away the non-existent cold sweat on his forehead. Just a moment before, he had thought that his fate was sealed. Even now, he was still wondering how he had survived. As the opposing army quickly dispersed, he finally caught sight of their assailant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Around a kilometer in front of him was a monkey-like Yin spirit that was standing at over three meters tall. It had three eyes and six ears, and it was giving off an unidentifiable aura as it stood atop a pile of skeletal warhorse corpses that was over 10 meters in height.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I am Envy.\" Envy swept its gaze through the surrounding area, watching all of the Yin soldiers around. It then abruptly opened its mouth before letting loose a thunderous roar. \"Who wishes to perish by my hands?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Reddish-black Yin energy erupted forth as formidable shockwaves fuelled by the power of its roar, and all of the surrounding Yin soldiers, including even the heavy cavalry units, were sent flying back several dozen meters like leaves in a windstorm. The netherfire in the eyes of all of the Yin soldiers around Envy were almost snuffed out, and just the mere sight of it was sending chills running down Zhou Yu's spine.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The existence of Envy was like a manifestation of horror, and when looking at it, one would see countless souls intertwined with one another, howling in grief and sobbing with agony. It was a scene even more terrifying than the path of the hungry ghost!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, a vast expanse of Yin energy that was not inferior in power to Envy's was gathering right in front of it, forming a Yin energy vortex that was several dozen meters in size.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A pair of hands slowly tore open the vortex.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hands belonged to a woman, and as she slowly emerged from the vortex, all of the surrounding Yin soldiers faltered momentarily, following which thunderous cheers instantly rang out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We pay our respects to the Reincarnation King!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long live, Hell!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Reincarnation King Arakshasa had arrived!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sea of countless Yin spirits had already taken shape behind her, and her dark purple hair was dancing wildly like a den of vicious vipers. Yin energy that was definitely not inferior to Envy's was surging out of her sleeves in enormous quantities, and she took a glance at Envy with her seductive eyes as a smile appeared on her face. \"Aren't you supposed to be an mid&nbsp;Yama-King? Have you been reduced to only a nascent Yama-King because you have no physical body? That's no fun! I won't get much of a sense of achievement out of beating you now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless Yin spirits howled in agony as she spoke. As an official Emissary of Hell, the regal aura that she carried innately had completely overwhelmed Envy's aura.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a battle between Yama-Kings, and all of the surrounding Yin spirits formed a circle, giving the two Yama-Kings a wide berth as their battlefield.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yin soldiers were filled with anticipation and anxiety as they looked on intently with unblinking eyes, but Zhou Yu's attention seemed to be elsewhere.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">We've made it into the inner circle!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beneath his visor, a hint of excitement had surfaced in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The military tactics employed by Chiyou's forces were extremely simplistic in the eyes of an expert tactician like him. There was an outer circle and an inner circle, with the former consisting entirely of cannon fodder, such as the 73 immortals, the Infernal Judges, the Anitya Hellguards, etc.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The outer circle's role was to chip away at Hell and blunt the attack of its army, while the inner circle was the true ace in the hole!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was certain that this wasn't the original plan for Chiyou's forces, but the vast disparity in the strength of the two armies had forced them to resort to these tactics.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the inner circle was Zhuolu, which was where the inner demon was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once they bypassed the inner circle, they would be able to charge straight into Zhuolu!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Go around them!\" In this battle, the 12 envoys were only thousand-man commanders, and even that position had only been granted to them in light of their past accolades in battle. Regardless of what anyone else thought, Zhou Yu cherished this opportunity greatly. He no longer wanted to be shunned and assigned roles that were completely unbefitting of his abilities!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thinking back to the heights that he had reached in the past, if he wanted to scale those peaks again, then he had to take some risks.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he could approach the inner demon and see into the core of Zhuolu, that would undoubtedly be an enormous contribution, and in his mind, the risk was very much worth taking!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin soldiers around him were a little hesitant. \"But we haven't received any orders from our higher-ups...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We can't always wait for orders in a battle like this. It's important to be able to adapt to&nbsp;the ever-changing situation,\" Zhou Yu countered as he immediately jumped onto his steed without any hesitation. \"I'm sure you're aware of the side-effects of the Judgment Pen.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, he didn't waste any more time with words and set off on horseback.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The surrounding Yin soldiers exchanged a few glances, then cast their eyes behind them in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There, a golden pen was dancing in mid-air, writing down one line of text after another. These lines of text were slowly fading away, and with each line that vanished, the Yin energy being released by the Yin soldiers would become slightly more powerful. Initially, the vast majority of the army possessed no cultivation rank at all, but at this point, most of them were already beginning to progress toward the Netherworld Operative level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If this entire army of hundreds of thousands of troops could all become Netherworld Operatives, then the overall might of the army would be significantly enhanced!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Qin Ye had made it no secret to them that only the underworld emissaries who survived this battle would be able to permanently retain their cultivation rank. This was not something that he could control. Instead, it was a special property of the three divine artifacts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">King Yanluo's Seal could improve the quality of Cathayan Yin energy, thereby resulting in a faster rate at which high-grade underworld emissaries arose, and this was why the Cathayan Underworld had always been the most powerful underworld. As for the Judgment Pen and the Book of Life and Death, they were like catalysts that completely activated King Yanluo's Seal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once activated, the ability of King Yanluo's Seal to improve the quality of Yin energy would be infinitely enhanced, thereby allowing it to produce a large batch of underworld emissaries in a short time. However, the underworld emissaries accepting this Yin energy would have to digest it through constant battle. If they couldn't do that, then their souls would be broken by the overload of Yin energy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In other words, even if Hell were to secure a crushing victory here in Zhuolu, there definitely wouldn't be many Yin soldiers who survived this battle. However, the overall quality of the Yin soldiers would take a massive leap.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Fuck it!\" One of the Yin soldiers pulled down his visor in a violent motion. \"We might all end up dead anyway, so what does it matter if we die a bit later or a little sooner? We've already died once anyway, let's do this!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The higher the risk taken, the greater the challenge, and the more severe the tribulation that their souls would have to transcend. Thus, perhaps this would be what allowed them to survive in the end!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, a group of around a dozen cavaliers spurred on their steeds to follow along behind Zhou Yu. More Yin soldiers quickly followed, and by the end, there were only fewer&nbsp;than 200 Yin soldiers left in this thousand-man battalion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one could've anticipated that a wraith-like unit would be sneaking through the battlefield, piercing directly toward the heart of the enemy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Yu inspected his surroundings in a cautious manner. Even though he had devised this plan, he wasn't an idiot, and he knew that the utmost caution had to be exercised.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The four Yama-Kings have all engaged their respective opponents in battle...\" He scanned the battlefield around him with a cautious gaze. The battlefield had been split up into four major sections, but none of the Yama-Kings from either side were attacking. This still wasn't the time for all-out war yet, so the Yama-Kings on each side were only present to ensure that the Yama-Kings of the enemy camp couldn't act as they pleased.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meanwhile, the Yin soldiers were locked in a fierce battle against Chiyou's remnant forces, and hundreds of specks of netherfire were rising up into the sky with each passing second. The battlefield had already transformed into an abattoir, and it was either kill or be killed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the 73 immortals had virtually all already fallen, and all of the demonic ghostly immortals had joined the battle. Thus, there really was a chance that he would be able to make it all the way to the heart of the enemy camp. His goal was only to scout out the situation there, and he certainly wasn't deluded enough to think that he could take on the inner demon himself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, Zhou Yu's attention was suddenly drawn to something.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were several groups of Yin soldiers around them who had also detached themselves from the main battlefield. They were traversing through the enemy forces like sharp scalpels, and they were also advancing toward the heart of Zhuolu!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who are they?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Yu was almost certain that these Yin soldiers weren't acting on their own. There had to be people leading them, and the only ones who Zhou Yu could think of that would have the same idea as him were his former comrades.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were a total of 11 groups, and they had clearly all noticed him as well, but they didn't say anything, either. Despite the lack of verbal communication, there was a tacit understanding between all of them, and they were aimed solely at the heart of Zhuolu!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From his vantage point high up in the sky, Qin Ye had immediately caught sight of these 11 groups.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It seemed that aside from Liu Yu, all of the other members of the 12 envoys had thought of the same strategy. Had they discovered something that no one else had? Were they trying to skirt around the battlefield to cut off the inner demon from behind?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, Qin Ye's eyes immediately lit up, and he couldn't help but internally commend the 12 envoys for their courage and decisiveness.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He looked on in silence at the 11 advancing groups, refraining from issuing any orders to them. Instead, all he did was wave a hand in their direction, and three threads that were invisible to the naked eye immediately shot forth toward them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unbeknownst to everyone, there were only three figures left at the center of Zhuolu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were a pair of Abyssal Prefects, and the inner demon, who was frantically injecting its Yin energy into the bone shard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The bone shard had turned an inky-black color, and all around the inner demon, a series of bright red gashes had appeared over the ground, branching out in all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The 12 envoys were advancing with courage, but the inner demon was also extremely confident.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Anyone who entered a 100-meter area of this place would be killed on the spot!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It cast its gaze toward the bone shard in its grasp, then heaved a faint sigh.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Activating the Myriad Soul Pagoda now definitely wasn't a wise option, but it was the only choice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was quite unfortunate as it was planning to use the Myriad Soul Pagoda at a later date, and the chances of success would be far higher if there were an extraterrestrial god present.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, it abruptly raised his head and cast its gaze toward the distance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ground was beginning to tremble.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two Abyssal Prefects had also sensed this, and they stood up in unison before turning toward the distance with incredulous expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A dark cloud of mist had permeated throughout a large area around them. The main battlefield of Zhoulu was still several kilometers away from the sea of mist, so there was no way that they should've been able to hear such loud, pounding horse hooves.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The fact that they were hearing this meant that someone was approaching this place!</span></p>"

The two longmas raised their heads and neighed with elation as they galloped joyfully around the inner demon at the top of the Myriad Soul Pagoda. The two sections of the corpse that were attached to their tails had already been reduced to bones, but right at this moment, a speck of golden soulfire ignited within the skull's eye sockets!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time of Chiyou's death, Hell didn't exist yet, so his soul couldn't enter the six paths of reincarnation. Thus, the only way to ensure that he couldn't resurrect himself was by physically separating his body. However, having been separated for thousands of years, the two sections of his body had finally been reunited!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His fingers twitched slightly, and the movement was extremely slight, but in the next instant, all of the clouds in the sky turned dark as day transitioned into night, and a terrifying scarlet color slowly began to appear behind the clouds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was still alive...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had been waiting for thousands of years for the opportunity to make a triumphant return!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Fuck...\" Even Zhao Yun could only curse out loud upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who could've imagined that the inner demon had possessed the keeper of the longmas all those years ago?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only a being as powerful as the inner demon could've done something like this right under the Yellow Emperor's nose!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Gusts of fierce crimson wind suddenly began to sweep through the area, causing Zhao Yun's armor to clink and clang incessantly. All of a sudden, he charged directly toward the top of the pagoda as a stream of silver light that was giving off incredible killing intent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye, Arakshasa, and the Harken followed along right behind him as three gusts of Yin wind, attacking the Myriad Soul Pagoda at full speed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of golden light flashed as Qin Ye's longsword was drawn from its scabbard, slashing a bright crescent through the air. This was accompanied by the Yin energy of the Harken and Arthis's Soul Shackles, all of which were aimed directly at the inner demon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What a powerful spear,\" the inner demon mused with a faint smile. \"Unfortunately, you're a little too late.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, he abruptly tightened his grip around the necks of the longmas that he was stroking, and the two longmas were decapitated in unison. The cross-sections of their wounds were as smooth as mirrors, and two plumes of crimson mist rose up into the sky from their wounds!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the four Yama-Kings that were doubting the inner demon just a moment ago positioned themselves in front of the inner demon as shields in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Let there be wind!\" Insanity's vessel was in the form of a thin middle-aged man, and his voice was like a gust of frosty wind sweeping through a valley.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Fierce wind immediately began to howl from all directions, and the wind was so strong that the arts unleashed by the three Yama-Kings were blown slightly off their original course.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, it was unable to stop Zhao Yun's spear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as Zhao Yun entered a 100-meter range of the Myriad Soul Pagoda, the tip of his spear crashed into an invisible barrier, and due to the excessive force behind the attack, his Courage of Dragons Silver Spear began to bend. Zhao Yun let loose a loud roar as the spear slipped out of his hand, following which he reached his right hand out toward his waist to draw his longsword.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, before he had a chance to lash out with the longsword, a faint thump rang out across heaven and earth, and at the same time, a faint golden light barrier abruptly appeared in front of Zhao Yun.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The light barrier was so faint that it was barely visible, but upon close inspection, one would be able to see countless archaic designs revolving incessantly all over its surface.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun faltered slightly upon seeing this, then heaved a long sigh as he slid his sword back into its scabbard. In the next instant, he was joined by the three Yama-Kings of Hell.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye reached out a hand with a grim expression to gently stroke the light barrier as he asked, \"Did you hear that just now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Harken gritted its teeth as it replied, \"It was the sound of a heartbeat. Chiyou's body has been restored, and he's already beginning to return to life!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye pursed his lips as he cast his gaze toward the light barrier up ahead, and before he had a chance to ask, Zhao Yun shook his head as he said, \"This is a barrier formed by fortune and faith. Chiyou was the only one who was capable of competing with the Yellow Emperor back then, and whoever came out on top would've created history. The fortune that Chiyou possesses is immense, and it's already encompassed the entirety of the Myriad Soul Pagoda. The only place we can exploit is...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The four of them turned toward that slope.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Aside from that part, the Myriad Soul Pagoda was devoid of any weaknesses!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, the enemy was also aware that the slope was the only vulnerable section of the pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From that slope, any level of the pagoda could be accessed, and at the top of the slope, the four Yama-Kings on the inner demon's side were assembled together, looking out at Hell's army with resolute expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the sequel to the battle between gods and demons that had taken place thousands of years ago, and it was going to decide the final ruler of Cathay!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of the enemy's unadulterated battle intent, Qin Ye raised his hand as he ordered, \"Everyone, get into formation! In one hour, we launch an all-out attack!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If you want a battle, then Hell will give you a battle!

At the center of the army, the Myriad Soul Pagoda was like a lone island in a hostile sea, waiting to be assaulted by the powerful waves to come.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the final showdown, and the army of Hell was completely assembled!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Warhorses were raring to go, while Yin soldiers were brandishing their weapons and flags. Amid the tense atmosphere, Qin Ye rose up into the sky, then looked down at the army as he declared, \"Throughout the entire history of the Cathayan Underworld, not once has there been a battle that we've lost!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A reminiscent look appeared in his eyes as he thought back to the days when he was all alone, facing and transcending all types of trials and tribulations to develop Hell to its current state.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were so many things that he wanted to say. He wanted to motivate his troops, but as all those past memories flashed through his mind, he was suddenly overcome by a myriad of emotions, and he roared in a deafening voice, \"We cannot hand over everything that we've built to someone else! Hell's history will not come to an end on this day, regardless of who tries to strike it down!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He cast his gaze toward the Myriad Soul Pagoda as he continued, \"If you want a battle, then Hell will give you a battle! Regardless of what you do, the outcome will always be the same! Attack!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of pounding war drums rang out, and Ban Chao's face was slightly flushed. It had been far too long since he had witnessed something that made his blood boil like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one could oppose the Cathayan Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He raised his longsword as he roared, \"Charge!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Directly ahead of him, the inky-black wave of Yin soldiers immediately sprang into action, resembling a black dragon that had awoken from a long slumber, charging directly toward the Myriad Soul Pagoda!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the forefront were still the heavy cavalry units. They formed the spearhead of the wave of destruction that was crashing violently toward the Myriad Soul Pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">BOOM!!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A resounding boom rang out as the Yin soldiers clashed with the Myriad Soul Pagoda. However, in the instant that they did so, the sound of a vigorous heartbeat suddenly erupted.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was like the sound of a pounding drum, and it was audible across all corners of the battlefield. The first Yin soldiers who charged into the slope were greeted by the sight of a scene from a primitive era over 5,000 years in the past. They were witnessing a burly and imposing figure, presiding over the battlefield like an invincible deity.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of the heartbeat rang out once again, and the sound went against all laws of physics and nature. In that same&nbsp;instant, that same heartbeat was heard by everyone across the entirety of Cathay!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The heartbeat rang out yet again, and it was as if some type of switch had been turned on. As soon as the Yin soldiers set foot into the pagoda, a violent reaction was triggered in the sky, and a series of ripples suddenly appeared over the four corners of the Myriad Soul Pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of metal clashing and grinding against itself rang out, and four thick chains descended from the heavens amid the ripples. The chains were emerging out of space bit by bit, as if they were drawn by a brush, and in the end, the chains were stretched taut as they locked themselves firmly to the Myriad Soul Pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The chains weren't spectacular to behold, and they were formed by black and white interchanging links. Surrounding each chain was an ever-shifting aura, taking on different forms such as different types of flora and fauna, or various types of scenery.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was profound bipolar metal!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Profound bipolar metal was a legendary material that hadn't been seen ever since ancient times. It existed somewhere between illusion and reality, and it was extremely difficult to forge, capable of locking onto all things either with form or devoid of form.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In addition to that, these chains were riddled with countless names, and just the mere sight of these names was enough to evoke within the beholder a sense of awe and veneration.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was the Gongsun Xuanyuan, Geng Chen, Chi Songzi, Chong Li, Yao Chonghua, Si Wenming...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of these names belonged to extremely renowned figures in history!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless names that had appeared in myths and legends throughout history were etched in glowing text onto these four chains!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the top of the pagoda, the inner demon was standing on the ground, holding a brush that was dripping with blood. The shaft of the brush was fashioned from a white bone, and the inner demon was inspecting its surroundings with a wary expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Four statues had appeared between the profound bipolar metal chains, depicting the Azure Dragon, the Vermilion Bird, the White Tiger, and the Xuanwu Turtle, and these statues were overlooking the entire Myriad Soul Pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Above the Azure Dragon statue, a flame that was around a meter in thickness slowly lit up, but it was also gradually fading.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Eight hours...\" The inner demon turned toward Chiyou's remnant forces with a serious expression. \"All you need to do is hold back Hell's army for eight hours, and the initial stage of your king's resurrection will be complete! During this time, he will be able to instinctively react to danger, and all you have to do is keep Hell's army at bay!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon set the tip of its brush down onto the ground, inscribing the first rune onto the pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the brush came into contact with the Myriad Soul Pagoda, invisible ripples instantly surged throughout the interior of the entire pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the sound of Chiyou's heartbeat rang out once again, and a vast sea of black mist descended from the heavens like a tsunami, instantly encompassing an area with a radius of several hundred kilometers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Stop them!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Keep the enemy at bay, even if it costs you your lives!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The four Yama-Kings who were allied with the inner demon instantly shot forth as four streaks of light hurtling down from above, while several hundred streaks of light filled the entire sky like a shower of shooting stars!</span></p>"

Thousands of specks of netherfire also came crashing down toward the side of the Myriad Soul Pagoda, presenting a truly surreal and breathtaking sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, none of this was able to stop the troops of Hell. On the slope, tens of thousands of heavy cavalry units formed a formidable black wave, which had already rushed several dozen meters up the pagoda. Behind them were hundreds of thousands of charging Yin soldiers, and the sound of long horns rang out across the heavens while countless flags were waving incessantly. The black wave was surging directly toward the only vulnerable spot on the Myriad Soul Pagoda with unstoppable force.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the final showdown that was going to decide who was going to be the ruler of Cathay, and neither side was willing to back down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!\" Chang Yuchun led from the front, forming the first wave alongside Zhou Yu, Ban Chao, Wang Meng, and the other envoys.

It was as if there were something in the darkness behind him, slowly reaching out toward him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the heavy cavalry units were connected by chains, and the chains on either side of him were clearly moving, but as he reached out, he was unable to touch anyone else. His hand traced along the chains, but it felt as if the chains stretched on for an infinitely long distance with no end in sight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who's there?!\" All of a sudden, he swept his longsword through the air, but failed to strike anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could hear the sound of faint breathing in the darkness.

It was extremely quiet, but at the same time, it was also somehow extremely invasive, influencing one's heartbeat to match the rhythm of the breathing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was Chiyou's breathing. The fact that he had begun breathing indicated that the resurrection process had well and truly begun, and there wasn't much time left for the army of Hell.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a burst of dazzling light suddenly shone down upon the darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was like a lighthouse in a storm, shining down from several hundred meters up above, illuminating every single corner of the darkness. The black wave in front of Chang Yuchun rapidly revolved, forming an inky-black vortex, and a burst of golden light erupted out of the revolving vortex.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Is this it?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For a brief moment, Qin Ye wondered whether he should enter the vortex, but he only hesitated for a split-second before flying into the vortex as a gust of Yin wind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, there was no going back!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, right as he rushed into the vortex, the entire world seemed to stand still for an instant, immediately following which Nothingness's voice rang out beside his ears. \"You only have four hours.

Upon entering this place, even Nothingness was clearly beginning to grow anxious, as evidenced by the fact that They had taken the initiative to approach Qin Ye and were speaking much more than normal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What's the deal with these Yin clouds?\" Qin Ye asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is an automatic defense measure.

He is rejecting your entrance to the Myriad Soul Pagoda. You really do not have much time left.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"I hope you can help us when the time comes.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nothingness didn't say anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I managed to break through the Myriad Soul Pagoda's defenses even without you.

Different body parts were drifting through the Yin clouds, including mouths, tongues, ears, eyes, and noses. They were like asteroids of an asteroid belt, revolving around the nine-petaled lotus flower platform at the center.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A scarlet lotus flower that was around 100 meters in size was growing, seemingly out of thin air. Its main stem was split up into countless branches, and several hundred scarlet lotus flowers were swaying in the darkness like stars in the sky. The army of Hell was situated layer upon layer several kilometers away from the lotus flower platform.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind the scarlet lotus flower was an open bronze gate, upon which were engraved extremely archaic&nbsp;patterns, and the gate was standing in the middle of space without any support structures.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was unable to describe what he was seeing in words, but he found this place to be extremely fitting as an ancient battlefield between gods and demons.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Fierce wind was blowing all around him, and Qin Ye didn't waste any time as he raised a hand. \"All troops, heed my call!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We're here, Your Excellency!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Prior to setting off, you've all already been assigned duties, so enact your duties as planned!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun abruptly raised his head as he cast his gaze toward Qin Ye, and he seemed to want to say something, but refrained from doing so in the end. Instead, he merely cupped his fist in a salute. \"Yes!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The assignment of duties had been completed prior to their attack on Zhuolu. However, at the time, they had been planning for a large-scale battle. Under those circumstances, even if Qin Ye were to face the inner demon on his own, the other Yama-Kings would be able to reinforce him. However, that was not the case now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had to overcome the enemy before the flames of the four symbols array burned out, so there was no time for delay!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the very most, they would only have four hours before Chiyou's return. They didn't dare to gamble, nor could they afford to take a gamble. The entire army was going to create an opportunity for Qin Ye to scale to the top of the pagoda, but that meant that he would be facing the inner demon on his own.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even with the Dusk Legionnaire at his disposal, there was no way that he would be a match for the inner demon. Thus, he would have to hold on for dear life until Zhao Yun arrived, but that was certainly easier said than done against an opponent as formidable as the inner demon!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency...\" Zhao Yun still wanted to say something, but Qin Ye shook his head to cut him off.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Myriad Soul Pagoda is like a hand that's slowly pushing us toward the edge of a cliff. Setting aside whether the four flames actually reflect the amount of time it would take for Chiyou to complete his resurrection, even if they do, we can't afford to play it safe and go up one level at a time. If the rate of Chiyou's resurrection exceeds the rate at which our army advances, then no one will be able to stop the inner demon with a resurrected Chiyou on its side. If that happens, the only solution will be to go to the world's gate and request assistance from the second King Yanluo, but that will only be a last resort. For now, we march!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, he immediately flew directly toward the gate as a gust of Yin wind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the saying went, fortune favors the brave, and Qin Ye could only hope to create his own luck through courage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A thunderous war cry rang out as all of Hell's troops advanced directly toward the bronze gate like an inky-black wave.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Come!

Let's see who will get the last laugh!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wang Meng was already primed to peak condition as he charged directly toward the bronze gate. The other envoys were advancing beside, forming an unstoppable wave that was sweeping through everything in its path.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the scarlet lotus flower at the center quickly spread open, revealing several hundred demonic ghostly immortals seated on the lotus flower platforms within the flower.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yin energy erupted into the heavens as an earth-shattering roar rang out, and a giant monkey Yin spirit with three eyes, six ears, and a forked tail abruptly stood up before letting loose a thunderous roar. \"Kill them all!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, several hundred bursts of netherfire and Yin wind swept through the air. These were the true elite among Chiyou's forces, and every single one of them was at least at the Anitya Hellguard level. In the blink of an eye, the sweeping Yin wind and flicking netherfire had given the entire scene a hellish complexion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Karmic Fire Legion, ready your arrows!\" Zhou Yu was spurring on his steed relentlessly as he charged on ahead with a fierce look in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of pounding war drums rang out, and all of the demonic ghostly immortals' eyes immediately widened at the sight that they were greeted by.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless balls of scorching crimson fire had appeared in the sky, numbering at least 100,000!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Fire!\" a general roared, and all of the arrows were released at once, flying through the air like rain to form a bright red bridge between the two armies. The storm of arrows was like a plague of locusts, eradicating everything in its wake, and several demonic ghostly immortals that were lacking in defensive prowess were immediately sent tumbling down amid agonized howls.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beneath the storm of scarlet karmic fire, the two armies clashed violently. Yin energy exploded through the air, forming shockwaves that were visible to the naked eye spreading in all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both sides were completely absorbed by the desire to vanquish their enemies, and right at this moment, a demonic ghostly immortal threw its head back and roared to the heavens, following which its body swelled rapidly in size, reaching a height of 20 to 30 meters in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Immediately thereafter, the mace it was wielding came crashing down with devastating force, instantly crushing around a dozen Yin soldiers. However, before it had a chance to unleash another attack, its body had already been sliced in half by Hell's army.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seated atop the lotus flower, Envy's Yin energy had already swelled to a peak, forming a terrifying vortex of reddish-black Yin energy that was several kilometers in diameter.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he wasn't doing anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was facing four Yama-Kings, so the best course of action for him was to remain still. However, that didn't mean that he was fearful of the enemy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy slowly stood up as he watched the approaching army.

Even though his hair&nbsp;was quite short, each and every one of them was like a lethal steel needle, striking all of the oncoming Soul Shackles and knocking them off their original path.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Oh? So you're not a complete pushover.\" Arakshasa remained concealed within the vortex as a red karmic flame lotus flower flew out. As soon as it emerged, the terrifying heat of its flames immediately caused the surrounding air to warp and shimmer violently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy's Yin energy erupted forth in full force, and his reddish-black Yin energy surged up into the heavens like a reverse waterfall. Amid the reverse waterfall, a pair of giant scarlet eyes slowly opened. Following an earth-shattering roar, the karmic fire lotus flower was abruptly destroyed, while the Yin energy around Envy exploded like a tsunami.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a result, it was revealed that he was a white monkey with three eyes and six ears. Close to half of his body had been stripped down to the bones, and he was wearing a beast hide skirt, holding a section of wood that was riddled with flowers that never faded, bearing fruit that never wilted. The monkey crouched down slightly, and in the next instant, it pounced directly toward the sky at an alarming speed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a thunderous roar of fury, the section of wood it was wielding was swung down with tremendous force, causing the entire space to tremble, and Arthis's Yin energy vortex was instantly destroyed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Even before your ancestors appeared, I was serving our revered king.\" Yin energy faded like the falling tide while Envy stood like an immovable pillar with a cold smile on his face. \"How dare an ant like you display such disrespect to me?

Soon, countless bursts of golden light had erupted into the sky!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire darkness was illuminated by the boundless golden light, and within the sea of light, a mystical and holy voice rang out, but in the span of less than a second, it had already transformed into an anguished howl of grief.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the souls in the six paths of reincarnation were wailing in unison as an enormous figure that was virtually the same size as Envy burst out of the Yin clouds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a massive Asura that resembled a statue, but it was most definitely a living being. It had three heads and six arms, and in its hands were six different items, namely a dagger, a skull, a string of prayer beads, a vase, a red spider lily, and a willow branch. It was seated on a lotus flower platform formed by the karmic flames of Hell, and all six of its golden eyes locked onto Envy in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Envy faltered slightly upon seeing this, and even he was astonished by just how formidable the Asura's Yin energy was. What was most alarming to him was that there was a hint of the power of worship interspersed within the Yin energy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His soul began to tremble violently, and in this moment, he felt as if he had returned to the Battle of Zhuolu, facing the most formidable foes he had ever battled.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never did he think that he would be struck by the same feeling in the face of another enemy over 5,000 years later.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He opened his mouth as wide as it would go, looking as if he had dislocated his jaw, then let loose a thunderous roar, releasing powerful soundwaves that forced Arakshasa downward. Immediately thereafter, an enormous circle of Yin clouds exploded over the ground, and Envy sprang up into the air before swinging his staff viciously down toward Arakshasa.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arakshasa's three faces were each displaying a different emotion, namely anger, elation, and grief, and in the instant that the staff came crashing down toward her, she stood up and raised two of her palms to the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A circle of king protea flowers bloomed all around her, and right as Envy's staff was about to strike the top of her head, she looked up before beginning to chant an incantation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of her joints began to crack and morph, and her body expanded further and further, threatening to encompass the entirety of heaven and earth. Right as the staff came into contact with her, Envy was stunned to discover that it had already been caught by the Asura's raised hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">…………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Violent Yin energy exploded in all directions, and even Qin Ye and Zhao Yun, who were charging at the forefront, could feel their clothes flapping incessantly around them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two Yama-Kings were going all-out from the get-go, and it was very unlikely that an outcome would be decided in their battle anytime soon. In fact, unless one of them decided to launch a kamikaze attack, it would most likely be a matter of days before their battle drew to a conclusion. The Yin energy shockwaves from their battle were sweeping through the entire battlefield, and both armies were pushed aside slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye paid no heed to all of this. Arthis was taking on Envy, and the army had been split up into three parts. Only around 100,000 troops had been left to her, and they were facing demonic ghostly immortals that were all Anitya Hellguards, Infernal Judges, or even Abyssal Prefects.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't want to think about the eventual casualties.

Even at the cost of their own lives, they were determined to slow the advance of the enemy Yin soldiers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the wake of the devastating self-detonations, several hundred Yin soldiers were killed on the spot, and thousands of Yin soldiers were severely wounded by the resulting shockwaves. However, even more Yin soldiers stepped up fearlessly to take their place. The two armies were like a pair of ferocious wolves, tearing into one another at all costs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the center of the battlefield, the battle between Arthis and Envy had also reached white-hot intensity. Both of them wanted to defeat the other as quickly as possible so they could help their respective armies, but that was certainly not an easy task for either of them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye withdrew his gaze, then turned to Zhao Yun before asking, \"Do you feel it?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun nodded in response with a grim expression. \"The level is sealing Chiyou's nine orifices.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once the seal was undone, the rate at which Chiyou's resurrection would progress would undoubtedly increase significantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Over 5,000 years ago, the Yellow Emperor was only able to dismember Chiyou's body, but was unable to do anything else.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, all of the other levels were perhaps sealing other parts of Chiyou's body as well. This was a race against time, and whichever side could achieve their objective faster would be the one that came out on top.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, both sides had to do everything in their power to get to their target first!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, Zhao Yun suddenly yelled, \"Get into formation!\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the bronze gate was right up ahead, and beyond it was a vast expanse of dazzling white light.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hundreds of thousands of troops swiveled around in unison, and the sound of pounding horse hooves echoed throughout this entire level. In the blink of an eye, the massive army fused as one, forming an enormous military formation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This formation was optimized for large armies to charge at the highest possible speed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hundreds of thousands of galloping Yin soldiers combined their momentum as one, advancing toward the second level like a heavy chariot with a vast expanse of Yin energy and dust swirling around it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From this point onward, they weren't going to stop until they reached the top of the pagoda!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As they drew closer and closer, the gate became clearer and clearer in their field of view, and right in the instant they reached the gate...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Clang!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of metal crashing into metal rang out in everyone's ears, and most of the Yin soldiers involuntarily covered their ears with their hands. However, as soon as they did that, all of them shuddered involuntarily, and a sense of extreme peril abruptly welled up in their hearts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sharp aura converged toward them from all directions, forming countless sabers, swords, spears, and other bladed weapons that descended from the heavens like shooting stars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Despite the fact that they were caught off guard by the attack, all of the Yin soldiers remained completely calm and collected. As a series of orders were issued, the original military formation immediately transitioned into something else, transforming into a reddish-golden divine bird in the blink of an eye. The bird was covered in reddish-golden fire, and it swooped toward the oncoming attacks with unstoppable might!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the Wumu Vermilion Bird Array!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!\" All of the army's generals raised their flags in unison as they roared with all their. They had already spent too much time acclimating themselves with their environment on the first floor of the Myriad Soul Pagoda, so they had no time to waste!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The heavy cavalry units charged ahead like an unstoppable war fortress, and even though the environment on this level was just as strange as the one on the previous level, no one stopped even for a moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a grave, but instead of people, it was swords that were buried here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Millions of swords were plunged into the ground in front of the graves, and they came in all types of different shapes and sizes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a tomb for swords!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">While Qin Ye had anticipated the presence of this entirely metallic world in the pagoda, this was still a very astonishing sight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was said that Chiyou's head was forged from metal, and his entire body was indestructible. Seeing as part of the seal had been broken, it was no surprise that some of his metallic aura had seeped out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, unlike the first level, there was no end in sight to this level, so under normal circumstances, the army would have to carry out scouting missions in order to find the entrance and altar leading to the third level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That would undoubtedly be an extremely perilous endeavor on this level, which was filled with Chiyou's metallic aura.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hold on...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's expression changed slightly as he suddenly sensed that the landscape on the second level wasn't actually imbued with the will and the aura of Chiyou. Instead, it was filled with another type of sharp aura that was suppressing everything on this level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the metallic aura of the White Tiger, and it was directly suppressing Chiyou's metallic aura!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We're not the only ones who want to put an end to all of this...\" Yin energy danced wildly around him as he suddenly drew his longsword before pointing it directly forward. \"The gods also want me to put an end to this vendetta that last stretched across thousands of years!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With all these hopes and expectations on my shoulders, how can I retreat?

Its inky-black hair trailed virtually all the way down to the ground, and it suddenly raised its head before casting a fierce gaze toward Qin Ye, as if it had sensed his scorching battle intent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, Hell's army still had over 300,000 troops left.</span></p>"

At the same time, gusts of ferocious wind were swept up, causing all of the swords in the tomb to ring and tremble.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lust's crimson eyes abruptly widened beneath her black hair.

In the next instant, she abruptly vanished, and as soon as she reappeared, her black hair fanned out like a pair of black wings, and she made no attempt to retreat as she charged directly toward Qin Ye while wielding a wooden sword.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the demonic ghostly immortals gathered in the entire tomb of swords roared in unison as they released their Yin energy in full force, advancing to meet the boundless black wave that was Hell's army.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two armies rapidly approached one another, and in the blink of an eye, there was only a distance of around 300 meters left between them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The tension in the air was palpable, and right at this moment, Hell's army split apart once again as they charged directly toward the bronze gate up ahead, while the 100,000 troops at the center clashed viciously with the oncoming demonic ghostly immortals.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Having split up yet again, the army had been reduced to only 200,000 troops, and there were still two levels left before they reached the top of the pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if two tsunamis had collided with one another as the two armies clashed with all their might. The enemy was reflected in the netherfire in the eyes of both sides, and even if they had to die, they were going to take as many of their enemies down with them!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yin energy erupted through the area as layers of shockwaves, and within the span of no more than several seconds, hundreds of specks of soulfire had risen up into the sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Neither side was holding back at all, and the battle instantly reached white-hot intensity as every attack was unleashed with the intent to kill. Meanwhile, the Yin soldiers of Hell on both sides were charging as quickly as they could toward the giant bronze gate at the back of the sword tomb.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">East Vanquishing General Fang Changqing raised his sword as he roared, \"Everyone, follow me!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">200,000 troops galloped along behind him, causing the entire sword tomb to tremble and quake. Having already built up significant momentum, Hell's army had transformed into an unstoppable juggernaut, and any demonic ghostly immortal that became entangled in it would quickly meet their demise.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're not going anywhere!\" Lust screeched as she rose up into the sky, and her black hair shot forth like lightning in all directions before plunging into all of the antiquated swords in the tomb.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Rise!\" With an earth-shattering roar, all of the swords in the entire tomb were pulled out of the ground by her hair.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Bursts of sword energy rose up from the ground toward the heavens, while Lust wore a twisted expression as she watched the two branches of Hell's army that were traveling around her.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, she twisted her own head around 180 degrees with all her might, and bursts of sword energy erupted out of all these antiquated swords in a frenzy, forming a long river of destructive sword energy that was several dozen kilometers wide.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the two advancing branches of Hell's army didn't even take a single glance at the oncoming attack. Right as the river of sword energy was about to strike them, a giant paw suddenly appeared in mid-air before quickly swatting the sword energy away!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lust faltered slightly upon seeing this, then immediately raised her head with a wary expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She could sense that she had been locked onto by an incredibly fearsome burst of killing intent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Layer upon layer of Yin energy rose up in front of her, rising to several hundred meters in height like a powerful tsunami.

However, the voice didn't stop there, and with each word that it uttered, the power of Hell's army would receive a noticeable boost.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Essence!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Fortune!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Wealth!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Luck!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Vitality!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Power!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that the last of the nine words was uttered, Yin energy gushed out of Lust's entire body in a frenzy, and she screamed as she retreated over 100 meters.

This was the God of Nine Energies that had faded into the pages of myths and legends for a century, but it had made its return here in the Myriad Soul Pagoda!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Boundless Yin energy was gathering within the Harken's mouth, and the Yin energy was so fierce and formidable that Lust's hair was blown into a chaotic frenzy.

There were only 200,000 troops left, and all of them had to fill the last two levels. There was no way that they would bring any Yin soldiers into battle against the inner demon as they would only be cannon fodder.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lust and Envy had already appeared, and they were locked in battle with the Harken and Arthis, respectively. Zhao Yun was going to face the Yama-King stationed on the next level, while Qin Hui, Su Daji, the 12 envoys, and all of the generals were going to lead the entirety of what remained of the army against the Yama-King on the final level. They were going to do everything in their power to keep the inner demon's subordinates occupied, even at the cost of their lives.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were still close to three hours left.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The inner demon is not someone that can be killed in three hours!\" Qin Ye said in a frustrated voice. \"Why aren't you getting directly involved? I have a vendetta against the inner demon, so I'm happy to be used by you, but you have to do your part as well! Are you just going to stand by idly and watch?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of Qin Ye's outburst, Nothingness remained completely emotionless as They said. \"You're still too young... You don't understand what it entails for one to be protected by fortune and faith. They are the ones chosen by the plane. The Battle of Zhuolu was the origin of human civilization in Cathay. Let me reiterate that Chiyou's fortune and faith aren't inferior to those of the Yellow Emperor, and as the will of the plane, there's no way for me to strike at someone chosen by the plane.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Ye had a chance to say anything, Nothingness continued, \"Chiyou's orifices, killing intent, body, and will are all sealed here. The inner demon is protected by Chiyou's fortune and faith, and there's no way I can strike at it without a suitable opportunity.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What constitutes a suitable opportunity?\" Qin Ye asked with gritted teeth while rushing ahead toward a chaotic halo that had appeared before him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, there was no reply.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Fuck!\" Qin Ye swore to himself before vanishing into the vortex.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the Heavenly Dao was wary of Chiyou, and he definitely didn't want to face Chiyou and the inner demon at the same time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had to get to the top of the pagoda as quickly as possible to prevent the inner demon from completing the ceremony. Otherwise, the consequences were going to be catastrophic!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the top of the pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless threads of blood were extending out of the pond of blood at the very center, quickly spreading along the runes that the inner demon had inscribed onto the ground. Two-thirds of the required runes had already been completed, and bursts of crimson light were rising up into the heavens, basking the Myriad Soul Pagoda in a crimson glow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A vast, primitive and antiquated aura was filling the entire area, making one feel as if they had gone back in time and returned to a far more primitive era. If anyone below a high-grade underworld emissary were to enter this place, they would immediately be crushed to the ground by this aura alone!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, the inner demon, who was inscribing runes onto the ground, raised its head before casting its gaze behind it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There, the flame of the Vermilion Bird statues had already faded, while the flame of the Xuanwu Turtle had been lit.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There are still three hours left...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It cast its gaze downward as it raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I'll admit that you're a troublesome opponent. You prepared this trap with the mortal realm, and I fell into it, but did you ever consider that what you thought was the prey could actually be the hunter? In one more hour at most, the blood array will be complete, and Chiyou's body will be restored. Who in this world will be able to stop both me and Chiyou?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on its face as it extended its bone brush toward the ground again, but right at this moment, the third sound of a bell being struck rang out, and less than 20 minutes later, a fourth bell chime rang out!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon looked up with a bewildered expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They've already reached the third level?

These lengths of rope were crafted from neither metal nor fabric, and all of them were already blackened with age. There were countless bone shards hanging from the strings, and they were clattering together in the wind like a soothing lullaby.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The pilots of the helicopters were constantly inspecting the monitor screens in front of them while their hands were resting beside a blue button, which was present in each helicopter. If any unrest or disturbance were to arise, they would immediately press those buttons without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">True Energy Spirit Vanquishing Missiles were the most advanced weapons against Yin spirits developed by the mortal realm during the 10 years of supernatural disasters, and they were only used to deal with evil ghosts at or above the Infernal Judge level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were over 100 helicopters present in the area, and each one was carrying four True Energy Spirit Vanquishing Missiles.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Below the helicopters were countless armored tanks that had arranged themselves into rows, and behind the tanks was an army of tens of thousands of troops. All of the soldiers and weaponry had yellow talismans plastered to them, which was quite amusing to behold, but no one was in the mood to be laughing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone's attention was focused intently on Zhuolu, and the Yin energy there had already gone beyond the threshold, making it clearly visible even to humans.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was exactly because of this that everyone was extremely fearful. The entirety of Zhuolu had already transformed into a viscous vortex of Yin energy, and if it weren't for the protection of artifacts, no one would've been able to stand here. Furthermore, just the mere sight of the enormous pagoda was enough to strike further fear into the hearts of the beholders.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zheng Shuguo and all of the Judge-level branch directors of the Special Investigations Department had already arrived on the scene, and scholars from the SRC were working frantically around them to calculate the Yin energy values.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Five billion... 5.5 billion...

Within the dark passageway, that lonely sense of isolation resurfaced once again, but Qin Ye didn't pause as he rushed directly toward the vortex up ahead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The wind was howling past his ears as he slowly calmed himself down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On this occasion, he was truly all on his own.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The vortex up ahead was growing larger and larger in his field of view as he drew closer to it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was charging into the final showdown, and there was no room for fear or doubts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, he crossed over a distance of several hundred meters, rushing directly into the vortex.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that he appeared, all of his blood and flesh faded, revealing a black skeleton that was wearing a regal crown and a golden dragon robe. Boundless Yin energy erupted out of his body as his longsword was drawn with a sharp whistling sound.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was his true form as a Yama-King!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had to face off against the inner demon and hold his own long enough until Zhao Yun arrived, so there was no room for any complacency or lapses in concentration.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As he descended upon the top of the pagoda, the Yin energy vortex expanded dramatically, opening up layer upon layer like a blooming flower. At the center of the pagoda was Qin Ye, but as soon as he arrived, a series of formidable attacks immediately erupted toward him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a boundless storm of swords!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The storm of swords consisted of swords of 13 different colors, and it formed an enormous sword lotus flower outside the Yin energy vortex that Qin Ye had emerged from. As soon as he appeared, all of the swords immediately came crashing down in a torrential downpour.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless swords of light plunged into the center of the vortex, and at the same time, Qin Ye let loose a loud roar as he slowly drew his longsword in response to the flurry of attacks.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a challenge from the inner demon, daring him to cross through this lethal storm to the other side.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of this gauntlet thrown down by the inner demon, a streak of dazzling white light swept through the entire space.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The white radiance seemed to have sliced the very air apart, and the sea of swords disintegrated into black butterflies in the face of Qin Ye's almighty attack. Amid the storm of black butterflies, Qin Ye and the inner demon finally found themselves face to face with one another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that instant, time seemed to have stood completely still.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several seconds later, Qin Ye slowly raised his sword before pointing it at the screen formed by the black butterflies. \"We meet again.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the screen, a familiar voice rang out in response. \"Indeed... You've certainly grown since our last meeting a century ago.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that the voice rang out, Qin Ye's pupils abruptly contracted. Prior to reaching the top of the pagoda, he had already adjusted his mentality to its best possible state, but in this instant, his heart was filled with unbridled killing intent!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of pure white sword energy swept over the ground, and the entire top of the pagoda was almost sliced in half. The sword strike had been unleashed by Qin Ye, and the ground before him split up toward either direction, while the black butterflies up ahead dissipated into Yin energy, finally revealing a familiar face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was an elderly man wearing a set of simple and crude attire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a face that had always remained in Qin Ye's heart, but one that he could never bring himself to think of.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Qin Zhongguo!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even those with the most exceptional mental fortitude had vulnerabilities in their hearts, and exploiting those vulnerabilities was what the inner demon excelled at the most. Not only did it enjoy pouring salt on the wounds of others, it relished tearing open old scars and mutilating them as much as possible.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no way that one could completely ignore the sway of their emotions, and Qin Ye's attack had been unleashed without any planning in advance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was only a single thought in his mind: \"I'm going to kill him!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the burst of sword energy had been stopped cold in its tracks by a single raised finger from Qin Zhongguo. It then raised its head slightly as it chuckled, \"Humans really are predicta...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before it had a chance to finish, Qin Ye's foot had already struck its face with vicious force!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Teeth, blood, and saliva were sent flying in all directions as the inner demon's head twisted around with a bewildered look on its face.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was shocked that Qin Ye could be so decisive and ruthless!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It didn't have access to Qin Ye's memories, but it did possess Qin Zhongguo's memories, so it was very much aware of Qin Ye's emotional attachment toward Qin Zhongguo, which was why it was certain that Qin Ye would hesitate!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once the vulnerability in Qin Ye's heart was uncovered, it would be able to take full advantage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before it had a chance to finish that thought, Qin Zhongguo's elderly body suddenly doubled over like a prawn. A punch had just landed on his stomach, and it had been thrown with such vicious force and decisiveness that it was as if Qin Ye were trying to punch cleanly through Qin Zhongguo's body!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon threw up another massive mouthful of blood as it was sent flying back several dozen meters, and it was completely astonished by the heartless display that Qin Ye was putting on!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a figure appeared above it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was none other than Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tears were following out of his empty skeletal eye sockets, but the netherfire in his eyes didn't waver in the slightest. It was a very strange paradox, as if Qin Ye's body were weeping, but his logic remained completely unshaken. The drastic contrast between the two had caught the inner demon completely off guard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had never encountered a situation so strange before.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, the Yin energy behind Qin Ye exploded violently, revealing a giant and complex rune that was constantly changing. At the same time, he accelerated even further, until he was barely traceable to the naked eye, and the golden sword in his grasp was slashed directly toward the inner demon amid a flurry of silver light.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I see...\" the inner demon murmured to itself, right before it was inundated by the wave of sword energy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sword energy was so vast and ferocious that the entire top of the Myriad Soul Pagoda began to tremble violently, and a series of cracks instantly began to rapidly extend in all directions. Sword energy was surging throughout the entire space, and countless dazzling white sword marks were lingering in the air, refusing to fade.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The assault was so fierce that the inner demon was almost shredded into countless pieces. Amid this devastating storm, Qin Ye's hand suddenly drew to a halt, and only then did the countless sword marks in the air begin to slowly fade.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Boundless Yin energy converged toward his arm, giving his entire arm an illusory appearance, and in the next instant, he unleashed the most powerful sword strike of his life!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Get out of my grandfather's body!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that earth-shattering roar, the sword strike was unleashed, and even the sun and the moon paled into insignificance in its wake, while heaven and earth groaned and quaked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a truly unmatched sword strike that was a culmination of every single ounce of power in Qin Ye's body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, in front of this almighty attack, a hand suddenly appeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a hand that was covered in blood and riddled with wounds, and it didn't belong there, but it had appeared there nonetheless.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a flick of a finger, all of the sword energy unleashed by Qin Ye was instantly shattered. From Qin Ye's perspective, he could only see boundless light surging back toward him, following which he was struck by a burst of immense force that he was unable to pose any resistance against. In that instant, he felt as if all of his senses had faded, and before he knew it, he had already been sent back flying several hundred meters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">White radiance filled the entire space as powerful shockwaves triggered a string of explosions in rapid succession in the surrounding air. The shockwaves erupted layer upon layer like a blooming lotus flower, feeding into one another as they proliferated outward in all directions, causing the entire space to tremble incessantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye fell heavily down onto the ground at the center of the top of the pagoda. His robes had been torn to shreds, his ribs had been broken, and his hair was completely disheveled.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He laid a hand over his own chest as he immediately rose to his feet, staring intently at the inner demon as he did so.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon didn't continue to attack.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't that it didn't want to, it was simply incapable of doing so.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Zhongguo's body was hanging on by a thread, and if it were to move, the entire body would fall apart.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His entire body was riddled with wounds, and blood was gushing out incessantly. The inner demon slowly inspected its own body as he raised its arms. \"I see that the origin rune of emotions and desires is the source of your confidence, but can you control your own instincts?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon grabbed onto its own head, and as it did so, all of the joints in its body were twisted to an unimaginable degree, making it resemble a human corkscrew.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Crack!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It snapped its own neck with its own two hands, and its head was dangling to the side as it abruptly turned around. \"So what if I do this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It then laid its hands onto its own stomach before pulling its hands apart, and Qin Zhongguo's entire body was drawn apart like a kite. \"Humans really are fragile.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye let loose a guttural roar of fury upon seeing this. Tears were still flowing out of his eye sockets, but the netherfire in his eyes remained completely unmoved, and he charged toward the inner demon with all his might.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The origin rune of emotions and desires was rapidly revolving behind him, but to no avail.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an instinctive reaction that wasn't governed by emotions. It was only natural that one's first reaction would be to lash out and exact revenge upon seeing their closest relative being mutilated.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He's fallen for it! Even though they've been evolving for thousands of years, humans haven't made any progress at all. All of them are just slaves to their emotions and desires. How pitiful!&nbsp;</span></p>"

The Yin spirit was holding a staff, and its skin was as dry as tree bark, while several strands of white hair trailed down from its otherwise bald head.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was Insanity of the four ominous stars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Gongjin!\" Ban Chao yelled as he charged at the forefront of Hell's army. The sound of pounding war drums was echoing throughout the entire level, while countless flags were waving in the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, the formation of the army underwent an abrupt change. The heavy cavalry units swapped places with the footsoldiers, and a series of large shields were raised before being pushed forward like a moving wall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, white light erupted from beneath the feet of all of the Yin soldiers before injecting itself into the wall of shields, upon which the shields began to glow with dazzling radiance, as if they were divine weapons.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the Wumu Xuanwu Shield Array!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the exact same moment, Zhou Yu rose up into the sky from the back of his steed, then roared, \"Karmic Fire Legion, fire!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that command, over 100,000 arrows were fired at once.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The arrows were like a plague of locusts, and Zhou Yu took a deep breath that seemed to stretch on forever, causing his entire body to swell up. In the next instant, he exhaled violently, releasing a wave of scorching fire that swept over a massive area.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a result, all of the arrows that had been fired were instantly set alight, and crimson light illuminated the entire sky as the arrows rained down upon the army of demonic ghostly immortals like a meteor shower, sending scorching heat and dazzling radiance surging down from above.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Rumble!!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arrows clashed as Yin energy exploded violently, sweeping up fearsome soundwaves and shockwaves that erupted in all directions. It was as if heaven and earth had been tipped on their heads, or as if magma were erupting out of the sky!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Under the bright red sky, the two formidable armies endured the soundwaves and shockwaves as they clashed viciously.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The battle instantly reached white-hot intensity, and netherfire was rising up into the sky with each passing second. However, right at this moment, a sharp howl suddenly rang out, threatening to tear the entire sky apart.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless blades of wind were hurtling down from above!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Die!\" Insanity screeched as he spread his wings, releasing countless blades of wind that shot fort in all directions. They were being dominated! Even though they were doing their best to acclimate themselves to this battlefield as quickly as possible, it was certainly not so simple to adjust to a disparity of several thousand years of battle experience in just an hour.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, even so, he was confident that they would be able to last over an hour as long as he joined the battle!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The blades of wind swept over the ground, and Chang Yuchun immediately dodged to the side in an incredibly agile manner, despite his burly frame. A trench that was 10 meters deep was sliced into the ground, and several Yin soldiers who weren't able to evade in time were instantly reduced to netherfire amid anguished cries.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the rest of the Yin soldiers were taking evasive measures in a very organized fashion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They parted layer upon layer, as if they were already prepared for this. High up in the sky, Insanity shuddered slightly as he caught sight of a silver figure with a flowing red cape behind the Yin soldiers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Ghost King Zhao Yun!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He stood like an immovable mountain with his Courage of Dragons Silver Spear shining as bright as the moon, and in this instant, he resembled a deity that had descended from Heaven. Yin energy was condensing all around him, forming a projection of a Buddha behind him!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was an inky-black Buddha, and right at this moment, Zhao Yun slowly opened his eyes to meet Insanity's gaze.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His eyes were completely emotionless, as still and tranquil as a picturesque lake.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An indescribable sense of horror suddenly welled up in Insanity's heart, and he immediately screeched as he rushed back frantically without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun didn't give chase. Instead, he began to chant an incantation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Bursts of radiance began to rise up all around him, filling the third level with dazzling golden lotus flowers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Boom!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as Zhao Yun completed his incantation, his body shot forth like lightning as he rushed forward at an inexplicable speed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was impossible to trace him as he flew through the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, all of the golden lotus flowers in the entire space wilted, and a clear phoenix cry rang out across the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By the time he reappeared, Zhao Yun was already right behind Insanity. Insanity's wings were spread wide open, and his eyes were filled with incredulity as he exclaimed, \"What kind of spear technique is this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, his body abruptly exploded into a shower of blood&nbsp;that fell from above.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's not something you'll be able to understand,\" Zhao Yun said in a casual voice, then abruptly vanished on the spot, charging toward the army of demonic ghostly immortals down below.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With each step that he took, an enemy life was claimed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Go!\" Qin Ye yelled, and the army split up once again. 100,000 of the remaining 200,000 troops were left behind, and the final 100,000 Yin soldiers advanced toward the bronze gate up ahead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the final level, and once they scaled it, they would reach the inner demon!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, right as the army split up into three groups, a shrill voice that was full of resentment rang out across the entire level. \"No one is getting through unless I'm dead!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Immediately thereafter, the blood that was raining down from the sky converged once again to reform Insanity's body. However, before he had a chance to complete his reformation, another spear strike pierced directly through his head, destroying his body once again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On this occasion, the rain of blood formed by Insanity's body dispersed even further, and at the same time, countless authoritative voices rang out in unison. \"Those who retreat will be killed on the spot! No one is getting past here unless I'm dead!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One Insanity after another quickly took form within the rain of blood, and they were all roaring with all their might, supporting the army of demonic ghostly immortals to ensure that their formation remained unbroken. In doing so, the morale of the army of demonic ghostly immortals was significantly boosted, and they were beginning to push back Hell's army!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun faltered slightly upon seeing this, following which a hint of respect surfaced in his eyes, and he turned to Qin Ye as he said, \"Please go on ahead, Your Excellency.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response, then transformed into a gust of Yin wind, wasting no time as he led the final 100,000 Yin soldiers directly toward the bronze gate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He knew that beings above the Yama-King level were powerful enough to easily defeat Yama-Kings, but even for them, killing a Yama-King was no simple task.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Upon reaching the Yama-King level, one's life force would undergo a fundamental evolution. If the Yama-King didn't want to be killed, then there was a chance that they would be able to escape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this situation, Insanity definitely had a chance to flee. However, he was choosing to burn through his own life force to guard this level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If things were to continue like this, he would be \"killed\" over and over again until he became a natural spirit with no consciousness whatsoever, and his cultivation rank would also plummet.

However, before Resentment had a chance to do anything, a flurry of flags rose up among Hell's army, following which bursts of interchanging black and white light erupted into the sky. Countless skeletal hounds pounced toward him with no regard for their own safety, and they were accompanied by hungry ghosts that were in a blind frenzy to devour everything in their path.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the chaos, a rumbling thunderclap rang out up above, and several demonic ghostly immortals were sent flying back hundreds of meters. A giant palm formed by bright red flesh and white bones had emerged, and that was what was responsible for forcing back the demonic ghostly immortals.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hundreds of meters up in the sky, dense Yin clouds had gathered, and a pair of crimson eyeballs lit up as Su Daji's cackling echoed throughout the heavens. \"Who dares to face me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the other side of the battlefield, countless skeletal hounds exploded violently, forming a vast skeletal vortex around an antiquated headless corpse in an official's suit from the Song Dynasty who was holding his own head. \"Hehe, when it comes to the number of people killed, no one on this battlefield can match me!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Resentment's killing intent had reached a peak, and he licked his own lips in a bloodthirsty manner. \"I'm going to kill every single one of you!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He couldn't catch up to that Yama-King, but he certainly wasn't going to allow these ants to live!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He cast a grim gaze up above.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Many-faced God, our forces have already been fully deployed into this battle, and even if we all die here, we'll have no regrets if our king is resurrected.

In the instant that the figure appeared, rainbow light suddenly lit up from the inner demon's palm, and a rainbow spear was sent flying toward the oncoming figure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless paper cutouts were torn apart before falling onto the ground like snow, and the approaching figure was also destroyed in an instant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It's not him!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon immediately shifted its gaze away from the humanoid figure, and right at this moment, countless paper cutouts split apart all around it as a series of ghostly figures rushed out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Freddy, Jason, Leatherface, Kwon Kyung-ho, the Spatial Spirit, the Porter Spirit... The entirety of the Dusk Legionnaire had been deployed! Ghostly shadows sprang from a human's worst nightmare toward the inner demon from all directions, swinging their weapons with all their might.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Freddy was cackling at the top of his lungs, and there wasn't even a single inch of unblemished skin on his burned face. All of the twisted blood and flesh beneath his skin was revealed, and he was staring intently at the inner demon with his bloodshot eyes as he swept his metal claws ferociously through the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A clear clang rang out, but the inner demon didn't even budge a single millimeter. Attacks from Abyssal Prefects had no effect on it whatsoever. In fact, it wasn't even paying attention to these assailants as it was looking beyond them, seeing if Qin Ye had also emerged alongside them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sharp blade flashed through the air as Otakemaru unleashed a blade projection that was over 100 meters in length. All of the paper cutouts in the blade projection's path were instantly sliced into shreds, yet this powerful attack wasn't even able to leave the slightest of marks on the inner demon's body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, all of the attacks struck the inner demon one after another, and shockwaves erupted over several kilometers while shredded paper rained down from above. Time seemed to have fallen completely still in this instant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You realized that you're no match for me, so you're resorting to impeding the resurrection of Chiyou, is that right?\" the inner demon scoffed, and in the next instant, all of the surrounding members of the Dusk Legionnaire disintegrated into Yin energy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon then raised its hand and seemed to hesitate momentarily before unleashing a burst of rainbow Yin energy, which transformed into a lethal spear that pierced directly toward Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, an earth-shattering boom rang out, and all of the paper around it was instantly set alight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They hadn't been ignited by netherfire. Instead, it was due to the fact that the spear was traveling at above the speed of sound, and the friction with the air was so extreme that it was able to set the paper alight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A trail of fire was left in its wake, and Qin Ye was instantly sent flying several kilometers backward as if a shooting star had just crashed into him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper cutouts in the wake of the spear fell away layer upon layer, only to rapidly reform again. Qin Ye gritted his teeth tightly with his arms crossed in front of his chest as a shield. His right wrist was so broken that it was completely unrecognizable, and he couldn't help but throw up a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was correct. It stood at the apex of the world in terms of power, so defeating it was impossible, but it was certainly possible to stop Chiyou's resurrection!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he couldn't do that through brute force.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just you wait...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye bit down viciously onto his own lower lip to stop himself from groaning in pain, and even as he was retreating, his eyes were firmly focused on the inner demon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had already set his anchor.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This certainly wasn't an extravagant or spectacular tactic, but it was the method that he thought had the best chance of succeeding.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Come! Attack me!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon stood on the spot in silence for a while, then turned back around.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It's not coming?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyelids twitched as his heart immediately sank. Had he failed, after all?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, right at this moment, the inner demon suddenly turned around again right in front of Qin Ye's despairing eyes. Immediately thereafter, it crouched down, and the muscles on its legs bulged as all of the Yin energy and power within its body began to swell rapidly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, it stepped forward, and a burst of shockwaves that were visible even to the naked eye swept violently over the ground in all directions. The thick piles of paper that had accumulated on the ground were instantly flung upward, giving the inner demon the appearance of a deity of death that had descended on a snowy night.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taking advantage of the instant before the paper cutouts managed to completely recover, it was able to lock onto Qin Ye!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It's coming!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unbeknownst to the inner demon, it was rushing right into the trap that Qin Ye had set for it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It's taken the bait! This is it!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The blood pond that Chiyou was in was naturally very important, but if it could capture Qin Ye, it would be able to ensure that it could bail out and escape! This was the perfect hostage, and there was no reason not to capture him!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon instantly vanished, and the howls and wails of the countless ghosts rang out across the entire space.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right in front of Qin Ye's eyes, a black shadow was rapidly expanding, and an indescribable sense of pressure was descending upon him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the inner demon in full flight!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was traveling so fast that words failed to describe its speed. It was like a ray of light, and it was virtually as fast as instantaneous teleportation!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's heartbeat began to drastically accelerate. As expected, the inner demon had been holding back during their prior battle. All smart cultivators knew the importance of keeping trump cards up their sleeves, but with the allure of taking Qin Ye as hostage being presented to it in this current situation, the inner demon was finally willing to display its full power.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon's raucous cackling rang out across the top of the entire pagoda as its hands swelled drastically in size in the air. It was also right at this moment, that the origin rune of emotions and desires behind Qin Ye began to revolve rapidly, ensuring that he maintained an extreme state of calm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His body was instinctively producing adrenaline with all its might, as one would expect in the face of an attack from a being above the Yama-King level. However, the origin rune of emotions and desires prevented Qin Ye from doing anything rash.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He swept a sleeve through the air, instantly releasing a vast Heavenly Dragnet. At the same time, he rushed forward with all his might, charging directly toward the inner demon's attack rather than taking evasive measures.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He couldn't afford even the slightest misstep here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had already walked onto the tightrope, and he either made it to the other side or fell into the abyss on either side of the tightrope.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon faltered slightly upon seeing this, following which the bone spikes on its back instantly elongated before intertwining with one another to form a pair of giant wings that completely enveloped itself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dragnet scraped over the bone wings, sending sparks flying in all directions, but were repelled and returned to Qin Ye's sleeve. At the same time, the inner demon's palm was still reaching out toward Qin Ye, but it had slowed down a little.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It did want to capture Qin Ye, but it definitely didn't want to capture a corpse.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The circumstances were different now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the prior battle, it would've definitely killed Qin Ye had the opportunity presented itself as it still had enough time back then. If it could kill an enemy Yama-King, particularly Hell's King Yanluo, then the morale of the enemy army would drop significantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Qin Ye was there for the taking now, and that was why it had chosen to leave the blood pond. In contrast with the prospect of having to face Hell together with a resurrected Chiyou, it much preferred the idea of capturing a hostage that would ensure that it would be able to escape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A living King Yanluo was the best hostage possible.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on Qin Ye's face, and his heart was fluttering like the wings of a hummingbird. The sound of his own heartbeat was ringing out in his eardrums as loud as thunder, but he was able to remain completely calm and collected due to the effect of the origin rune of emotions and desires.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His energy, essence, and spirit had all been primed to a peak.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had been waiting for this moment this entire time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had been waiting for the inner demon to make this choice. Seeing as the inner demon had come out and abandoned Chiyou, he was certain that it definitely wouldn't kill him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just as he predicted, the power of this attack was severely lacking. The inner demon had no choice but to hold back in order to ensure that Qin Ye could survive. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Qin Ye immediately pulled out Fate and injected his Yin energy into it, upon which it transformed into a massive white umbrella.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The umbrella shielded Qin Ye from the attack, and not only was the inner demon not able to capture Qin Ye, it wasn't even able to break through Fate!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon faltered slightly upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Something wasn't quite right...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The tempo of the battle was off! Qin Ye was acting very strangely considering the situation!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Could he be plotting something? But what could it be? Even with all four of Hell's Yama-Kings together, they might still not be able to defeat me... In that case, he could only be targeting... Chiyou!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as that thought occurred to the inner demon, it immediately abandoned Qin Ye and rushed back toward the pond of blood.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon had caught on to what was happening extremely quickly, but it was still too late! Qin Ye was virtually completely drenched in blood, but he paid no heed to that as he injected all of his energy into Fate, which transformed into a spear, then thrust it toward the rapidly retreating inner demon with all his might.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Piss off!\" the inner demon roared. It could clearly sense that something irreversible was about to happen, and it had no time to waste on Qin Ye. All of the bone spikes on its back detached themselves from its body, then transformed into hundreds of skeletal crows that converged toward Qin Ye in a frenzy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a silver spear emerged from the side, and all of the surrounding Yin energy and paper cutouts quickly scattered to either direction. In the blink of an eye, Zhao Yun was revealed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yin energy surged violently as Zhao Yun's enormous power caused the entire surrounding space to shimmer and warp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Stop him!\" Qin Ye roared with all his might.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun immediately sprang into action upon hearing this, thrusting his silver spear forward like a dragon springing out of the sea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why is he here?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that Zhao Yun had already been waiting here for some time, and he had accumulated a significant amount of power for this spear strike. How had he gotten here so quickly?!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the inner demon knew that it had been led in a wrong direction, but it didn't have time to think about how things had played out like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sense of foreboding in its heart was quickly becoming more and more pronounced by the second, and it let loose a thunderous roar as its body instantly transformed. However, right as it completed its transformation, a burst of dazzling light suddenly illuminated the entire sky.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was an attack unleashed by Zhao Yun's sword, and there was no way to evade it. The entire space was virtually sliced apart by the attack, and the inner demon's frustration had mounted to a peak.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an opponent that was on par with it. Under normal circumstances, it would take at least a day for it to defeat Zhao Yun, but it didn't have anywhere near that much time in this situation!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All it had done was stray away from the pond of blood for an instant! How had things escalated so quickly?!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of Zhao Yun's attack, the inner demon's body instantly disintegrated into countless vengeful spirits, all of which rushed directly toward the blood pond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone across the entirety of Shanxi Province could see a gigantic sword mark, which had appeared in the sky above Fenglingdu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun's sword strike had split the heavens!</span></p>"

In the blink of an eye, the finger was struck millions of times, thereby knocking it to the side!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of dazzling light swept over a corner of the top of the pagoda, completely erasing that corner. However, the inner demon knew that its attack had failed to strike its target.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Where is he?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon hurriedly inspected its surroundings to search for Qin Ye, and as it did so, it was completely stunned by what it saw.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Paper cutouts were raining down from the heavens, and there were still more flocking to the scene before converging to the top of the Myriad Soul Pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Millions of Divine Heavenly Guardians were arriving by the second, and they concealed the entire sky, forming layer upon layer of paper with their paper swords pointed directly at the inner demon. It was as if heaven and earth had transformed into a cage of paper, and the paper cutouts that formed the cage were quite comical to behold, but the inner demon was in no mood to laugh because it was unable to sense Qin Ye's Yin energy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is... the Qimen Dunjia!\" it spat through gritted teeth, then immediately swept its right hand through the air without any hesitation. Countless Divine Heavenly Guardians to its right instantly exploded, flying through the air as countless shreds of paper. However, the shreds of paper formed a barrier that even its consciousness was unable to penetrate, and after descending onto the ground, the shreds of paper quickly stood up once again!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no end to them!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon's gaze swept through the world of paper around it like a sharp blade, and several seconds later, a cold smile appeared on its face. \"So this is the ruler of Hell?

A cold sneer appeared on its face as it chuckled in a mocking voice, \"You're nothing but a cowardly turtle! I killed tens of thousands of Hell's Yin spirits and wiped out the entirety of Safesoul City, yet you don't dare to do anything to me! You don't even have the courage to face me!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Its voice rang out like rumbling thunder across the top of the pagoda, but it received no reply.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Its ears were twitching slightly as if they were radars, trying to capture even the slightest sound around it, and a few seconds later, it exhaled as it stood up straight again, then scoffed, \"What a useless coward you are.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I can't do anything through these paper cutouts, and he won't come out...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It seemed that this was a predicament with no solution, but the inner demon quickly cast that thought aside and returned to the center of the pond of blood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper cutouts had covered everything, but were unable to cover the pond of blood in which Chiyou's head was situated, and it was as bright as a star in the night.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon stopped at the edge of the blood pond, then cast its gaze toward the statues on the four corners of the top of the pagoda, which the paper cutouts had also failed to conceal, and in doing so, it discovered that the final flame, that of the White Tiger, had already been ignited.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We're into the final hour...\" The inner demon licked its lips as it cast its gaze toward the head in the blood pond, which had already opened its eyes. \"You must be very much looking forward to returning as well, right? After all, you've been absent from this world for so long...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Around three kilometers away, Qin Ye was watching intently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper cutouts could cut off the inner demon's senses, but they didn't affect him at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Qimen Dunjia was a type of concealment art to begin with, and this was the original version created by Lishan Laomu, so its protective and concealment properties were top-notch.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, what was he supposed to do now?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't that he hadn't been enraged by the inner demon's provocation, the problem was that he would simply be offering his head up on a platter if he were to rush out now! Even though his fingernails were digging into the palm of his hand, such was the force with which he was clenching his fists, he didn't move at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had to endure this and remain calm...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gnashed his teeth together tightly as his mind began to race.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing as the inner demon had given up on attacking him, he was fully confident that he would be able to last until Zhao Yun arrived. However, even after that, would they be able to defeat the inner demon within an hour?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't sure about that. In fact, he was rather pessimistic about their chances.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unless the Heavenly Dao decides to intervene, there's no way any of us will be able to kill the inner demon!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the Heavenly Dao had told him that the inner demon was currently protected by the fortune and faith of Chiyou, thereby rendering Them unable to attack it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that case, how could he remove the inner demon from this protection?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Myriad Soul Pagoda is the final trump card left behind by Chiyou... Could it be that the inner demon will be protected by Chiyou's fortune and faith as long as he's in the Myriad Soul Pagoda?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't know the answer to that question, but it was the only glimmer of hope.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they could kill the inner demon within the final hour, there would be no one to complete the resurrection of Chiyou, and even if they only had a minute left, they would be able to seal him again!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't allow himself to be swept up by emotions as he knew that he most likely only had one opportunity. If he couldn't make that opportunity count, then he would have to face the inner demon directly with Zhao Yun by his side.

Bao Chao had been nailed to a mountain by a massive ax, and his hands were dangling limply beside him, while his flailing legs were unable to reach the shaft of the ax.

Qin Zhongguo's physical body was completely torn apart, and in its place arose a skeletal giant that was three meters tall. Its entire body was covered in muscles, sinews, and bones, and its back was riddled with bone spikes, while bone scythes were growing out of its elbow joints.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the bone spikes on its back thrust forward with vicious force. As they did so, they transformed into Yin energy of 13 different colors that surged toward Qin Ye's seven orifices.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point in the battle, it was already supremely confident.

A victorious smile had already appeared on the inner demon's face, yet right at this moment, Qin Ye suddenly stopped cold in his tracks before flying back several hundred meters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How could this be?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon looked on with an astonished expression. Its Yin energy had already come into contact with Qin Ye's clothes, transforming into purplish-black feelers that were riddled with eyes and mouths, frantically trying to sniff out something. However, the complete loss of control that Qin Ye had just exhibited had vanished in the blink of an eye!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How had he accomplished this?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon cast an incredulous gaze toward Qin Ye, and right at this moment, a series of golden characters appeared all over Qin Ye's robes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His entire body was basked in golden light, and he finally calmed down as he said in a trembling voice, \"Are you surprised?

However, in a battle of life and death, one would inevitably default to their most familiar style of battle, and never did he think that Qin Ye would have a foolproof plan to counter what it excelled at the most.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin energy vortex quickly dissipated, revealing a skeleton that was over 10 meters tall.

The inner demon wasn't using any arts, it was merely crushing Qin Ye with its absolute Yin energy advantage. Qin Ye had a feeling that if he were to continue fighting fire with fire, his body would be shattered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, this still wasn't the inner demon's full power!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that attack, the inner demon vanished once again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was unmatched killing intent and peerless power all around Qin Ye, and there was no time for him to react. The golden sword in his hand transformed into a ball of golden light, and a string of loud clangs rang out in rapid succession in the air while large sections of the ground on the top of the pagoda were shattered explosively.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For a whole three minutes, neither of the combatants could be seen. Three minutes later, Qin Ye's body was sent flying like a cannonball amid a muffled groan, following which he crashed heavily into the statue of the Vermilion Bird.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was hovering in the distance, and all of the golden eyes on its body abruptly sprang open. In the next instant, boundless rainbow light swept over the entire top of the pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a completely unavoidable attack with no blind spots, and it was as if a sun had risen up above the Myriad Soul Pagoda!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye drew a sharp breath upon seeing this, and an inky-black ripple instantly proliferated outward from his body. Right as the ripple appeared, the boundless light descended like a divine tribulation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was using the Untouchable Love ability to protect himself from this attack, yet as soon as the attack arrived, Ryu Changmin's panicked voice immediately rang out in his mind. \"He's too powerful! I can't keep up!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ryu Changmin was only an Abyssal Prefect.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was an extremely unique Yin spirit with exceptional abilities, but the disparity in cultivation rank was simply too vast to be bridged.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What do I do?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's mind was racing. He still had more tricks up his sleeves, such as the Heavenly Dragnet or the mutual teleportation ability. However, if he were to use any of those abilities, the inner demon would definitely grow extremely wary, and it would become virtually impossible for him to damage the array here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a very peculiar array. It had been inscribed onto the ground, but even though the ground had already been severely ravaged during the course of their battle thus far, all of the blood characters had detached themselves from the ground and were hovering in mid-air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to think about anything else, a resounding boom rang out, and the light that was 10 meters away just a moment ago abruptly descended upon him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time seemed to have fallen completely still, and the Yin energy ripple around Qin Ye instantly disintegrated right in front of his astonished eyes. The Book of Life and Death immediately flew out of his chest, forming another layer of defense.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless names appeared upon it, and those names transitioned between golden and inky-black in color as the Book of Life and Death released a burst of incredible power to keep the light at bay. However, before Qin Ye even had a chance to catch his breath, all of the light before him suddenly converged and transformed into a massive rainbow sword.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though Qin Ye was already mentally prepared for this battle, he still couldn't help but be struck by a sense of despair.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was far more powerful than he was. Even with the Book of Life and Death, there was no way he would be able to withstand this attack.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You are the third person to ever see this attack.\" The inner demon's voice rang out from all directions. \"I've given it a nice name: Godslayer.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, the golden sword exploded violently, and an indescribably powerful burst of force completely inundated Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A golden sun rose up into the sky from the top of the Myriad Soul Pagoda, illuminating the entire heavens.

With each cough, copious amounts of blood would gush out of his mouth, and his body was a complete mess. If it weren't for the Dusk Legionnaire's mutual teleportation ability, the Yellow Emperor Protector Seal would've most likely already been activated.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the inner demon descended slowly in front of him, and an icy cold finger was pressed against his glabella.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Am I about to die again?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye wanted to muster up some strength so that he could at least face his demise with some dignity, but he found himself unable to summon any strength, and he felt as if his body had been split apart at the seams.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"A weakling like you has no right to act as the ruler of Hell,\" the inner demon said in a cold voice, and black light was quickly converging toward its fingertip.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, something suddenly clattered gently onto the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both the inner demon and Qin Ye reflexively turned to see what it was, and it turned out that a jade hairpin had slipped out of Qin Ye's grasp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a very ordinary hairpin, and it was not remarkable in any way.

It was like the explosion of a nuclear weapon that impacted the entire world, and circles of Yin clouds were slowly spreading toward all directions with Fenglingdu at the center, presenting a breathtaking sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, all of the darkness began to rapidly converge toward the Myriad Soul Pagoda, making it resemble a funnel in a sea of ink.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A giant butterfly projection that was over 100 kilometers in size rose up into the heavens from the center of the funnel.

With the pagoda's destruction, the countless Yin soldiers in the pagoda also fell back down onto Zhuolu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The long vendetta between the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou had finally drawn to a conclusion in this moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right in the instant that the ghostly face vanished, Qin Ye's body gradually began to fade before suddenly disappearing as well!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">…………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was feeling extremely sluggish.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Every single nook and cranny in his body felt as if it had been filled with lead, and it was as if his eyes had been sewn shut.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wanted to open his eyes to see what had become of the inner demon and Chiyou, but the exhaustion was too great, and his consciousness quickly faded away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slept for what felt like an eternity, and by the time he reopened his eyes, the first sight that he was greeted by was a pure white world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was an ancient temple constructed from ice. It was extremely beautiful, and all of the flora and fauna around it were also carved out of ice in an extremely meticulous and lifelike fashion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a world that sat above a sea of cloud and mist, and at this moment, Qin Ye was situated in a spacious room of ice. Even though the entire room was constructed from ice, it was somehow very warm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His brows furrowed slightly as he inspected his surroundings, and he then took a moment to inspect his body, upon which he discovered that he had already made a full recovery, and his powers had advanced even further.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unfortunately, he still wasn't close to reaching above the Yama-King level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're awake.\" Right at this moment, a familiar cold and aloof voice rang out from behind him. Qin Ye didn't even bother to turn around as he stood up before performing a few stretches, cracking his own joints one after another as he asked in a casual voice, \"Is this your divine nation?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no response, so Qin Ye took that as confirmation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He casually inspected his surroundings as he said, \"I must say, it really suits you, given your personality.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is only a part of my divine nation, situated on the peak of Mount Everest.\" Nothingness slowly made Their way over to Qin Ye. At this moment, They were in the form of an elderly and benevolent Taoist priest, as if They were trying to make Themself appear not so cold and indifferent, but there was no way to hide Their inherent nature.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They made their way out of the temple as They said, \"You've already been sleeping for two whole years.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Do They want to have a chat?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye hurriedly followed along behind Them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two of them slowly strode along the icy path outside, passing by a series of empty temples before the Heavenly Dao finally said, \"The battle at Fenglingdu went completely beyond my expectations. Out of the original army of Hell, there are still over 100,000 troops remaining, and they've all undergone breakthroughs following their return to Hell.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I see.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"After the inner demon left the Myriad Soul Pagoda, I intervened to erase it out of existence in person...

Otherwise, given your personality, you wouldn't even take a second glance at me. In this plane, the only person worthy of your respect is the second King Yanluo. As for everyone else, they ultimately all exist within the boundaries of your laws. Only those who can go beyond the boundaries of your laws will be acknowledged by you, right?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You brought me here because you feel like the balance of karma is skewed, that your laws are unbalanced. I helped you kill the inner demon, yet you didn't do much throughout the entire process, so you feel like the interaction wasn't fair. Thus, you decided to bring me here. To be honest, I really do pity you sometimes. Were you the one who created the laws or are you just a slave to them?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao raised Their head and cast Their gaze up toward the clouds in silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long while, They finally said, \"That's a completely pointless question.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that the Heavenly Dao didn't want to discuss this subject any further, and They said in an indifferent voice, \"I am both the creator and the enforcer of laws, and all laws must abide by the policy of fairness. Hell did indeed contribute far more to the battle of Fenglingdu than I did, so as the spokesperson of the laws, I should offer you a token of gratitude.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They made a grabbing motion, and the space before Them rippled slightly. By the time They spread their fingers open, a rainbow ball had already appeared on Their palm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is the soul of the inner demon.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ball seemed to have been formed by Yin energy, and it was glittering and translucent. Every single second, there seemed to be countless anguished souls wailing within it, and the Heavenly Dao said, \"Any underworld emissary at the Infernal Judge level or above can immediately make a breakthrough to become Yama-King after devouring this.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye drew a sharp breath upon hearing this, and a hint of burning desire appeared in his eyes as he looked at the ball.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was something capable of instantly creating a Yama-King! It was no exaggeration to call it a divine artifact!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't that he hadn't killed high-grade underworld emissaries before, but all high-grade underworld emissaries who perished either returned to heaven and earth, or naturally dissipated into Yin wind or netherfire. However, the Heavenly Dao was somehow able to regather the inner demon's soul after its death! Just how powerful were They?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The value of an item like this could not be overstated. With it at his disposal, he could give rise to a fifth Yama-King at any time! However, the question was who he should give it to.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wang Chenghao wouldn't work, he wasn't suited to serve as a Yama-King. Su Daji and Qin Hui were out of the question as well. They were loyal at the moment, but there were permanent blemishes on their past. If he were to give them something so precious, what were the people who had followed Qin Ye from the very beginning supposed to think?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After thinking for a while, Qin Ye discovered that Qin Changxin and Qin Xinzhong seemed to be the only suitable candidates. However, they didn't believe in the religions of Cathay, and without the power of worship from their native Nipponese Underworld, could this thing really succeed?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, a name sprang into his mind, but he quickly repressed it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was something that he had to think long and hard about.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao paid no heed to what Qin Ye was thinking as They continued onward, and a giant gate of ice appeared up ahead. With a wave of Their hand, the gate swung open.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Given how astonishing the first present had been, Qin Ye was already mentally prepared for what was to come, but even then, he couldn't help but be stunned by the sight of what was beyond the gate of ice.</span></p>"

Within the Yin energy, a giant mouth that was radiating nine-colored radiance sprang open, revealing a black hole with a radius in excess of 100 meters within!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">BOOM!!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Scintillating radiance filled heaven and earth, completely eradicating the darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the dazzling light, the vengeful spirits rapidly disintegrated as countless black shadows shot forth in a frenzy. These shadows were all formed by Yin energy, and they came in all types of different shapes and forms, including humans and different types of beasts. Some were flying through the air, some were galloping along the ground, some were standing atop flying swords... Each of them was only around an inch in size, and they were all frantically rushing toward the pond of blood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon knew that something extremely terrifying and irreversible was about to happen!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this instant, the inner demon experienced fear for the first time in thousands of years. The sense of peril in its heart was growing clearer and clearer, and right at this moment, its soul shuddered as it cast an incredulous gaze toward the pond of blood. As a result, all of the tiny black shadows stopped cold in their tracks.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A figure slowly stood up beside the blood pond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Kwon Kyung-ho, and there was a chain connected to his body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of the chain stretching taut rang out, and all of the miniature shadows turned around with stunned expressions to find that the other end of the chain concealed somewhere up Qin Ye's sleeve!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was panting heavily. If he were a normal human, the injuries that he had sustained would've already been lethal. Even as a Yama-King, he was barely able to remain on his feet, but he was still tugging tightly onto the chain.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless paper cutouts descended on either side of the chain like snow right as it was stretched taut.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I see...\" all of the miniature shadows murmured in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this instant, the inner demon finally understood what had happened.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Firstly, Qin Ye's attacks definitely hadn't been unleashed blindly and aimlessly. Instead, his objective was to fling all of the paper cutouts into the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the attacks unleashed by Qin Ye and the inner demon against one another had shredded countless paper cutouts, and those shreds of paper had piled up onto the ground. That played right into Qin Ye's hands as Lishan Laomu's Qimen Dunjia was about to conceal his Yin energy and that of his allies.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he didn't give the inner demon any time to think before launching an attack, and that was precisely why the inner demon had chosen to leave the pond of blood to try and capture Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Through his actions, he was implying that he was able to see the inner demon's location.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The pond of blood was at the center, and if Qin Ye couldn't see the inner demon's position, there would be no way for him to be sure that the inner demon was there. If he had launched an attack under those circumstances, he would be exposing himself while attacking completely aimlessly, and that would be no different from committing suicide.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon had immediately caught on to this, but due to how abruptly this opportunity had presented itself, the inner demon didn't have the time to consider another question, which was whether the Qimen Dunjia was concealing other people aside from Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The answer to that was yes!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not only was the Qimen Dunjia concealing Qin Ye, it was also doing the same for Zhao Yun, the Harken, and Arthis, who had just made it to the top of the pagoda.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon was unaware that the other three Yama-Kings had arrived! In its mind, capturing Qin Ye presented no risk and provided it with a foolproof safety net, and in its haste to take Qin Ye as hostage, it had failed to consider just how many people there were on the top of the pagoda at this moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, it had rushed away from the pond of blood, thinking that it would definitely have the last laugh.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In retaliation, Qin Ye had unleashed his Heavenly Dragnet, and even though it had been withdrawn shortly thereafter, one of the Soul Shackles in the Heavenly Dragnet was connected to Kwon Kyung-ho, who was moving stealthily forward with his body concealed by the piles of shredded paper, and his Yin energy concealed by the Qimen Dunjia, thereby resulting in this current situation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even as Qin Ye's opponent, the inner demon couldn't help but be impressed by his impeccable planning and foresight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In what seemed like a dire situation, he had come up with the best possible plan in a very short time, and it was a flawless plan with traps laid every single step of the way.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Well done,\" it sighed as it turned toward Qin Ye. \"I underestimated you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on Qin Ye's face as he said in a strained voice, \"If you had chosen to remain at the pond of blood at all cost, it would've been very difficult for us to bypass you in the time that's left, so the best way was to divert you away.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon heaved a forlorn sigh.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Where did I go wrong? What incorrect decisions did I make? How have I suddenly fallen into this dire situation?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, an unexpected turn of events suddenly took place.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kwon Kyung-ho was abruptly decapitated out of the blue, and there was still a stunned look on his face even as his head flew up into the air. Immediately thereafter, his body began to rapidly disintegrate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Resentment!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had arrived on the scene just in the nick of time, and everyone's attention had been focused on the inner demon, so no one had noticed him!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was also panting heavily, and his injuries were no less severe than Qin Ye's, but he stood as determined as ever as he yelled, \"Go! Don't let our deaths be in vain!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one had anticipated something like this, and the despair in the inner demon's heart was instantly erased as all of the miniature shadows rushed directly toward the pond of blood at an incredible speed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was greeted by a devastating paw strike from the Harken.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hundreds of the miniature shadows disintegrated into Yin wind, but the inner demon didn't pause even for a single instant. At the same time, Zhao Yun flew through the air like lightning as he said, \"The inner demon is hidden in one of them! The only way to track it down is to destroy all of these shadows!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slashed his sword through the air as he spoke, unleashing a vast expanse of sword energy that shredded countless surrounding paper cutouts in an instant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the storm of shredded paper that was falling like snow, the inner demon gave a pained groan, yet all of the miniature shadows took on a crimson color and accelerated even further!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, right at this moment, all of the miniature shadows stopped cold in their tracks once again as they cast their eyes toward the pond of blood with incredulous expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kwon Kyung-ho had vanished, and Qin Ye had taken his place!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the Dusk Legionnaire's mutual teleportation ability!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No!\" The inner demon let loose a desperate cry, and Resentment also faltered slightly upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hope that had just been ignited in their hearts was instantly snuffed out again as he rushed frantically toward the blood pond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everything seemed to slow down in this moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two Yama-Kings instinctively raised their hands in unison. One of them was wielding a broken blade, while the other was holding the bloodstained Fate, and both of their bodies were riddled with wounds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their injuries were just as severe as one another's, and they shouldn't even have been able to move, but in this decisive moment, their determination and resilience lent them the strength to unleash one final attack.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time seemed to stand still for a moment. In the next instant, Resentment's head flew up into the air, and his eyes were filled with deep sorrow as he murmured, \"I've done everything in my power, my king...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of Yin energy rose up into the heavens, and Resentment's body disintegrated into a flurry of black butterflies.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The cultivation rank advantage that Qin Ye had over Resentment had proven to be decisive.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Resentment's saber had also reached Qin Ye's neck and had sliced two to three centimeters into it. Blood was gushing out of the wound, staining half of Qin Ye's entire body red, and the blade wasn't far away from decapitating him as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even as the two were facing lethal blows from one another, neither of them had backed down even half a step!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Black butterflies were fluttering before Qin Ye's eyes, but he paid them no heed. He seemed to not have sensed his injuries at all as he heaved a faint sigh of relief, then plunged Fate down toward the pond of blood with all his might!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Stop!\" The inner demon was about to go insane! Never did it think that this would be the final outcome. All of its Yin energy erupted in a frenzy as it transformed into a black shadow, flying past Zhao Yun and the Harken at an unimaginable speed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A pillar of blood erupted out of the pond, and an indignant and furious roar rang out throughout heaven and earth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if a nuclear bomb of sound had been detonated, and all of the trees across the entirety of Shanxi Province were bent backward, while shockwaves that were visible even to the naked eye instantly swept over the entire city of Yuncheng!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Fate had already transformed into a spear that had plunged directly into Chiyou's glabella in the pond of blood.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Chiyou's eyes had already sprung open, and he was staring up at Qin Ye with an incredulous expression. \"How dare you?!

Yuncheng was encompassed under Lishan Laomu's array, so the head would definitely fall within the boundaries of the city.

Everything is over now...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, he fell unconscious to the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was nothing more that he had left to give.

The other three pillars aren't stupid, and they've already backed down after failing to breach our Cathayan Underworld's defenses for over 10 years. The fact that the attitudes of many of the underworlds toward our Cathayan Underworld has begun to shift is a clear indication of this. They wouldn't dare to do that if the three pillars were going to oppose our Cathayan Underworld to the very end. It's already been several years since the new energy resource was released, and as long as their advisors aren't completely useless, they'd realize that even if our Cathayan Underworld had been standing on its last leg, these past few years would've been enough for us to make a rapid recovery. Of course, in reality, we're nowhere near as powerful as they imagine. However, are we going to continue to isolate ourselves just because of that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice began to grow louder as he spoke. This was something that he had to say, as even if he were to encounter resistance from the department directors, Qi Ye would be able to shore him up. If Qin Ye were to say this and encounter resistance, then there would be no backup, and it would be difficult to bring up the subject again in the future.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"As our Cathayan Underworld continues to develop, we'll definitely have to open up the Array of the Nine Gods. The array existed to protect us, but at the moment, it's already severely restricting our information exchange pathways with the rest of the world. Our Yin energy optical fibers are unable to go beyond our borders, and our military is also unable to reach the rest of the world. Thus, our presence is absent from the entire underworld, and as a result, we're reducing our own influence. However, if we remove the array, there's no way that we would be powerful enough to withstand an attack from the three pillars. The underworld is not a safe place, and the only thing that can ensure our safety is power. Only during the past few centuries did wars that wiped out nations gradually disappear. We must prove ourselves to the entire netherworld once again!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just like during the Gulf War in the 90's, where Usonia had shown the world once again who was the boss.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Influence and speaking rights in the world were priceless assets, and a small nation could disregard such things, but they were extremely important to major nations.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one said anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, everyone already understood Qin Ye's intentions, but this was far easier said than done.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the very least, it would take several dozen more years of preparation before they could implement this plan.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, an elderly man in a Mao suit stood up to speak with a serious expression. \"Yanluo Qin, given how expensive carrier molds are to produce, there are definitely no more than 30 of those molds across the three pillars. There's no way we can just sacrifice a second-generation forbidden art carrier mold for no reason! These are extremely precious assets that we must manage carefully.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This man was the top dog of the military arms department, General Xie Yong, so it was no wonder that he was so familiar with forbidden arts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xie Yong continued, \"The production cost of a second-generation forbidden art can only be higher than that of a first-generation forbidden art, and at the moment, the cost of a forbidden art could make a severe dent in our nation's finances.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A smile appeared on Qin Ye's face.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What Xie Yong was thinking was that they would simply detonate a forbidden art for demonstration purposes. The other three pillars could do that, but with the current state of affairs of the Cathayan Underworld, this wasn't something they could afford to do.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the implication was that if a forbidden art had to be detonated, then there had to be a target, so what was this target going to be?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye sat up straighter as he smiled and said, \"Indeed, detonating a second-generation forbidden art would be extremely taxing to our nation's finances, and at the moment, we can only detonate two at most. The first one will be detonated for all of you to see as a proof of concept. As for the second one, that will naturally before the entire world to see. Not only will we show them the second-generation forbidden art, we have to make an example out of something so that no one thinks about messing with us again!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the first row, Qin Changxin was furiously writing down notes, but the tip of his pen suddenly drew to a halt.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A thought seemed to have occurred to him, while all of the other directors thought of something else, and they turned toward Lu Ban in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Spacecraft-launching technology + second-generation forbidden arts...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This combination would essentially allow them to launch nuclear weapons!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of this formidable combination, any underworld's defenses would be instantly destroyed! Following the detonation of the forbidden art, enemy morale and defenses would be in shambles, and that would allow Hell to crush them with its army, even after having so many troops killed during the Battle of Zhuolu. In fact, that would only make the rest of the world more astonished by how the Cathayan Underworld was able to conquer the enemy with so few troops!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everything had clicked into place, and it seemed that Hell really was preparing to instigate a war between underworlds!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, they couldn't publicly declare the second-generation forbidden arts. After all, the treaty on the non-proliferation of forbidden arts had only been re-signed less than 20 years ago. However, they could easily just change the name into something like Alpha Missile or Xuanyuan Sword Art...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In any case, they were going to stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that these were forbidden arts, and there wasn't anything anyone could do about it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency...\" Qin Changxin finally opened his mouth to speak, and his voice was trembling slightly as he asked, \"Where will the... testing site be?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye looked straight into his eyes before asking, \"What do you think about Amano-Iwato?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hall instantly fell deathly silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, the netherfire in the eyes of all of the officials present sprang up drastically.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I concur,\" Xie Yong immediately said before Qin Changxin had a chance to reply.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Immediately thereafter, several more directors concurred one after another. How could they pass up such a brilliant opportunity?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a war to conquer a nation! Perhaps it was still quite far away in the future, but if they could play a part in making such a massive contribution to the Cathayan Underworld, then surely they would be given favorable reincarnations in the next life!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I concur!\" Qin Changxin rose to his feet, then cupped his fist in a salute and extended a deep bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The promise that had been made to him was finally about to be fulfilled, and it seemed that there was no chance that they could fail!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had one being above the Yama-King level, an advanced Yama-King, and two Yama-Kings, in addition to second-generation forbidden arts coupled with launching technology... How could they possibly lose?!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He knew that the purpose behind the second-generation forbidden art was not just to crush Amano-Iwato's defenses, but also to make up for the losses in Yin soldiers suffered during the Battle of Zhuolu. In addition to that, it was a warning to the entire world, telling them that a second-generation forbidden art would be coming their way if they dared to make a move against the Cathayan Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Take a seat, everyone,\" Qin Ye said with a smile. \"This is only an idea at the moment. Let's call this idea the Nippon plan for now. I'll have to trouble President Lu and President Zu to make the plan possible. Everything will hinge on when they can complete their research and development. That will be the end of this meeting. Director Qin, please stay behind.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the directors quickly departed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This meeting was a perfect reflection of Qin Ye's style, which was to do things quickly and efficiently, but just because it was over quickly didn't mean that it wasn't impactful.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They knew that from this point onward, there were many things that they would have to prepare.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the only ones left in the conference hall were Qin Ye and Zhao Yun, while Qin Changxin eagerly entered the small conference chamber.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only now did Zhao Yun allow himself to heave a sigh of relief. \"It's a really good thing you thought of a way to gradually build up to that announcement. Otherwise, the directors wouldn't have agreed to the idea of initiating a war against another nation so soon after the Battle of Zhuolu.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's about time that we flex our muscles to the world,\" Qin Ye said in a cold voice. \"Izanami has been overstepping her boundaries for far too long. During the 20 years of my reign, she has constantly been provoking the Cathayan Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun raised an eyebrow upon hearing this. \"Is that the only reason we're starting this war?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's not the entire reason,\" Qin Ye replied with a faint smile. \"We have to look after our loyal subordinates too. I made a promise to Qin Changxin, and I have to follow through.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, Qin Ye changed the subject. \"There's something that I haven't told you. Anyone at or above the Infernal Judge level can immediately become a Yama-King under any circumstance after consuming the soul that the Heavenly Dao extracted out of the inner demon.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun immediately raised his head upon hearing this, and a thought seemed to have occurred to him as he said in a trembling voice, \"You don't mean...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye continued, \"If I recall correctly, Yue Fei's soul is in the Nipponese Underworld, and that's the true reason why this war has to happen!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the end of the day, Qin Changxin was still Oda Nobunaga.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Yue Fei was in the Nipponese Underworld, and he wasn't a Yama-King!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once Yue Fei became a Yama-King, the top-end power of Hell would receive another significant boost. Furthermore, this was a display of power to the entire world, and in addition to that, there was the promise that had been made to Qin Changxin and the need to teach Izanami a lesson for her transgressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, there was a combination of reasons that made the Nipponese Underworld the ideal target, and Qin Ye couldn't think of any better candidate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was like they were asking for it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun took a deep breath, then cupped his fist in a salute, yet just as he was about to depart, he suddenly asked, \"What about Qin Hui?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"He's in luck,\" Qin Ye replied. \"He and Su Daji have truly put their lives on the line during the Battle of Zhuolu, so I'll let him live even after we recover Yue Fei's soul.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye had always been fair and just in his administration of rewards and punishments.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On this occasion, Zhao Yun didn't say anything and vanished from the room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye also departed. Seeing as they were going to make a move against Amano-Iwato, the first step would be to get an understanding of Amano-Iwato's military prowess.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Two gusts of Yin wind flew into the conference chamber, and Qin Changxin immediately stood up from his chair before extending a deep bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency...\" His voice was trembling with emotion. \"I didn't think you would truly fulfill your promise! I am extremely fortunate to have made the decision to follow you!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No need for formalities, Director Qin. Take a seat.\" The trio sat down, and Qin Ye smiled as he said, \"You and I have known each other for a long time, and you watched Hell grow from essentially nothing, so you're no less invested in Hell than I am. As such, it's only expected of me that I fulfill my promise to you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thank you, Yanluo Qin!\" Qin Changxin stood up again before extending another deep bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Cups of fragrant tea were quickly brought into the room, and Qin Ye took a sip before continuing, \"I'm sure you already know why I asked you to stay behind.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course!\" Qin Changxin rose to his feet and bowed for a third time as he cupped his fist in a salute. \"I'll be sure to tell you everything I know!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had been waiting for this moment for centuries!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, he was about to reclaim the Nipponese Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After sitting down again, Qin Changxin was silent for a few minutes, as if he were carefully contemplating his words. Only after five minutes had passed did he begin to speak. \"Your Excellency, I don't know if there have been any major changes in Amano-Iwato during the past few centuries, but I can tell you everything from before that.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He repressed his own excitement as he continued with a serious expression, \"Firstly, Amano-Iwato is different from all other underworlds as it's an underworld inhabited by both ghosts and demons, and there are even some so-called deities there!\"</span></p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the gate was a round hall that was filled with ice statues of different deities, including Nüwa, Jesus, Zeus... There were a total of seven statues, each of which was over 100 meters tall, while the hall was over 150 meters in size, presenting a grand and majestic sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the center of the seven statues, a head that was around 10 meters in size was hovering in mid-air with its eyes closed. A series of golden chains that were completely formed by runes were extending out of space around it, disappearing into its orifices to keep the head suspended.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a complete skeletal head with three eyes and a head of fiery red hair.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was no longer displaying any signs of life, yet its hair was slowly dancing in the air like a nest of snakes, and a series of extremely eye-catching scarlet patterns were visible on the skull.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The skull was giving off a sense of indescribable power that was vast and all-conquering. Even as it hovered in mid-air in a stationary manner, it was causing the space within a radius of several dozen meters around it to ripple incessantly, and it was as if it didn't belong in this world at all. It was clear that the owner of the skull had to have been an extremely mighty figure during their living days.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye could only think of a single person who could possess a skull like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is this Chiyou's skull?\" He swung around as he turned to the Heavenly Dao with a bewildered expression. \"Are you giving it to me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao's expression remained as indifferent as ever, and They merely nodded in response. \"You don't want it?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I do! Of course I do!\" Qin Ye was ecstatic! Having resolved the crisis in both the underworld and the mortal realm, the next item on the agenda was for the Cathayan Underworld to develop its second-generation forbidden arts and space exploration technology. For these endeavors, the skull of an ancient god that was blessed with fortune and faith was an extremely useful asset!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What was he going to do with it? He was going to create a super telescope, of course!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This thing was essentially a divine artifact when it came to space technology development! It had been incredible to him that Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa had used the remains of the fifth sun god to create their telescope, and even after obtaining the document outlining the Omeyocan plan, he didn't think that he would ever be able to replicate it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, with Chiyou's head, the Cathayan Underworld was going to become the only nation in the underworld with a publicly known super telescope, and that was going to happen in the near future!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao took a glance at him, then swept a hand through the air, and Chiyou's skull transformed into a streak of light that fell into Qin Ye's grasp. Only then did Qin Ye discover that there was still another gate up ahead!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to think about anything else, time stopped for an instant, following which both he and the Heavenly Dao arrived in front of the gate at the same time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Heavenly Dao laid Their hand onto the gate of ice, and They were just about to open it when They suddenly stopped before turning toward Qin Ye. \"What do you think is going to be inside, Yanluo Qin?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't immediately reply, and truth be told, his heartbeat was rapidly accelerating at this moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Whatever was beyond this gate had to be extremely precious. The first present provided by the Heavenly Dao was the soul of the inner demon, which was an extraordinary item that could instantly create a Yama-King. The second present was Chiyou's head, and whatever was beyond this gate had to be even more valuable than the two previous items. Otherwise, the Heavenly Dao wouldn't have saved it for last.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of possibilities quickly flashed through his mind, and several seconds later, he asked with barely repressed excitement in his voice, \"Is it the Qimen Dunjia?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an extremely powerful array, and it was something that only Lishan Laomu possessed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they could make the array large enough, it would be an all-encompassing concealment array, and that would be considerably beneficial for the potential military operations that the Cathayan Underworld could be about to undertake soon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on the Heavenly Dao's face as They slowly pushed the gate open.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of deep rumbling rang out from the gate, and natural light flooded into the hall. Instead of leading toward another room, this gate led toward the outside world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Outside was a vast sea of clouds with the occasional mountain summit peaking through, resembling small islands on the sea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Qin Ye's gaze wasn't drawn to the spectacular scenery. Instead, he was looking at the enormous entity sitting above the sea of clouds!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was overcome by a rush of excitement that temporarily robbed him of the ability to speak, and there were fireworks going off in his head.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Up to this point, he had everything he needed to facilitate space exploration!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He couldn't wait to return to the Cathayan Underworld to begin the new journey.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"With that, we're even now.\" The Heavenly Dao made a grabbing motion, and the enormous object transformed into a ball of light that flew into Qin Ye's palm. \"This will most likely be our last meeting unless extraterrestrial gods invade this plane.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everything in the surrounding area was quickly fading away, and Qin Ye faltered slightly before suddenly yelling, \"Why are you giving these things to me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Within the span of less than 20 seconds, everything faded away into nothingness, and it was as if the majestic palace of ice had never appeared in the first place. It was also at this moment that a slightly forlorn voice rang out. \"I am destined to be bound to this plane, unable to step into outer space. However, I possess the ability to pave the way for others to step out of this plane, in pursuit of alternate worlds. The second King Yanluo told me that they really do exist...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">So They want to pass on Their dream to someone else...&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A gust of fierce wind swept over the summit of the mountain, and Qin Ye gently arranged his own hair as a smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, the Heavenly Dao really did seem like an intelligent being.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, that no longer had anything to do with him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He took a deep breath as an excited look appeared in his eyes, and his heart was brimming with motivation. He couldn't wait to finally restore the Cathayan Underworld to its rightful place at the top of the world!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everything that he had done prior to this still wasn't enough! He wanted the Cathayan Underworld to officially regain its place on the four pillars without any dispute, and in order to do that, the Cathayan Underworld had to flex its muscles to the rest of the world!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He cast his gaze toward the direction that Nippon was situated in, then vanished into thin air in a flash.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">………………………………………………..</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everburn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not many people were aware that their King Yanluo was absent, and the other Yama-Kings were already accustomed to having to fill in for him. Unfortunately for them, they had ended up with an unreliable King Yanluo who seemed to be absent most of the time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, Zhao Yun and the Harken took turns assessing official documents in Qin Ye's place, while Arthis returned to her leisurely job as the ruler of the six paths of reincarnation. Of course, that was only after her proposal to serve as secretary to Zhao Yun was sternly turned down by Zhao Yun himself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The tip of Zhao Yun's pen was quickly flashing over a sheet of paper. The Cathayan Underworld had well and truly entered a period of rapid development, so there wasn't much for them to do, and they didn't need to be as careful and cautious as they had been when Hell was first founded. All they needed to do was support this rapidly growing nation to ensure that it didn't grow in the wrong direction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">News of Hell's victory over Chiyou at Fenglingdu had already spread across the entirety of the Cathayan Underworld, and it was all that anyone could talk about. Chiyou was a vastly renowned demonic deity in the history of Cathay, yet he had been defeated by their administration!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Every single netherworldly citizen was filled with a sense of patriotic pride and confidence. Following the battle, only less than 200,000 troops had remained of Hell's army, and upon their return, they had been welcomed by the netherworldly citizens of Everburn on the streets, stretching for over 20 kilometers out of the city!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the past two years, the main focus had been to promote these soldiers who had participated in this battle up the ranks so that they could become leaders in the military and rebuild Hell's army. After all, the battle against the inner demon had put a severe dent in Hell's military forces.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a reward for their valiant efforts during the battle, Su Daji had been promoted to become the administrative commissioner of the Pearl Delta, while Qin Hui had also had his wish of becoming the governor of the two easternmost provinces fulfilled.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All that was left was to continue to develop the education industry, as well as the industrial revolution and technological boom brought on by the new energy resource.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Phones, LED screens, televisions, lightbulbs... Everything in the mortal realm that could be useful in the underworld had already appeared in the underworld at this point. This wasn't very difficult, considering they were able to take the blueprints and designs straight from the mortal realm, then make slight adjustments so that they would be suitable for usage with the electricity-like energy string. Over the past few years of development, Hell was already progressing toward a national network.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the moment, the Cathayan Underworld was in a prosperous state that was rather difficult to describe through words. It was filled with antiquated cities with wooden buildings, and all of the netherworldly citizens were wearing antiquated attire, while those who wore suits were looked down on. However, whenever nighttime arrived, the entire city would be brightly lit, with countless streetlights along the main roads, illuminating the carriages drawn by Yin beasts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun was in the process of assessing a report filed by Heavenly Man Pictures against Southern Manor Films for establishing a monopoly. In the grand scheme of things, this was completely trivial, and if he didn't want this report to be presented to him, it wouldn't even have appeared on the desk of King Yanluo at all. However, Zhao Yun had never seen a movie before, and he was very intrigued by things like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Oh? Are you interested in movies?\" Right at this moment, a familiar voice rang out beside Zhao Yun, whose eyes immediately lit up as he rose to his feet with a relieved expression.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency, you're finally back! After the battle against the inner demon, the Heavenly Dao arrived in person to take you away, and we couldn't do anything.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye poured himself a cup of tea before taking a sip, upon which an impressed look appeared on his face. \"It tastes like tea leaf production technology has improved.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Indeed. The improvement took place as a result of an invention from last year that uses the new energy resource.\" Zhao Yun smiled as he sat down onto the taishi chair across from Qin Ye, then asked, \"Now that you're back, would you like to hear a report for the last two years?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was extremely eager to make some big moves, but prior to that, he had to develop an understanding of where the nation was currently at.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He took a sip of tea, then said, \"Get all of the department directors to make some preparations, and we'll hold an annual report tomorrow... Actually, scratch that. I'm sure they reported everything directly to you during the past two years. Just gather all of them for a meeting, there's no need to make it too official. You'll be participating in the meeting as well, and you can give me a rundown of everything that's happened while they fill in the gaps.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun nodded in response, following which his brows furrowed slightly as he asked, \"Your Excellency, are you not planning to declare your return to all of the departments?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had a feeling that Qin Ye was about to make some big moves following his return.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the past, the first thing that Qin Ye did following his return from trips would always be to inform the nation of his return, thereby assuring the netherworldly citizens. However, it seemed that he wasn't planning to do that, which indicated that he was planning to do something more important.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There's no need for that,\" Qin Ye replied with a mysterious smile. \"We'll be holding two conferences back-to-back, and everyone will know that I've returned by then.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Conferences? What type of conferences?\" Zhao Yun asked as his expression changed slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye smiled as he gestured for Zhao Yun to come closer, then whispered something into his ear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun's pupils immediately contracted as he heard what Qin Ye had to say, and he abruptly rose to his feet with a stunned expression. \"Have you already made a decision?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I never go make careless promises,\" Qin Ye replied after taking a sip of tea. \"The Cathayan Underworld's return to the top of the world is inevitable, but first, we have to return to our former position, and I think there's one final step left before our position is restored. If we continue developing like this for the next five centuries, we'll be on par with the other three pillars, but 500 years is too long. I want to make a move now! I think it's time for us to flex our muscles!\"</span></p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus concluded the short meeting, and everyone departed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing as a plan to strike at the Nipponese Underworld had already been devised, certain factors had to be considered in advance, and preparations had to begin right away. These preparations included conscription for the next few years, officially recovering the Hanyang Underworld, and construction in the Strait of Tsushima and the three eastern provinces.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After this meeting, all of the directors were undoubtedly going to begin to make some moves. However, there was still a lot of time left, so there was no need to rush.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The other factor to be considered was the pressure from other underworlds. The three pillars were definitely going to get involved. After all, this was going to be a blatant denial of an underworld's right to exist, so the three pillars were undoubtedly going to be deploying their troops. According to the current plan, the idea was to intercept these troops with the second-generation forbidden art. However, a question arose from that arrangement: who was going to intercept these troops prior to the detonation of the forbidden art?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The armies of the three pillars were definitely no joke. During the conference in Nara, Qin Ye had witnessed Erinys's Golden Fleet. The naval might of the three pillars was certainly nothing to be scoffed at, and once their troops were deployed, they would definitely be led by death gods.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, they had to stall those troops until the second-generation forbidden art descended upon Amano-Iwato. Where was that battlefield going to be? Who was going to command Hell's army? Which Yama-Kings were going to be deployed? All of these things had to be arranged.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, they had to consider just how powerful the Nipponese Underworld's resistance was going to be.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the prerequisite to all of this was the development of second-generation forbidden arts and launching technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye returned to his own office, then read through some official documents in an absentminded manner before tossing them aside. He sat in his chair in contemplation for a short while, then summoned Wang Chenghao into the office. \"Inform President Zu and everyone else who needs to be notified that I'll be making a trip to the Sword Coral Research Institute tomorrow. You'll be coming with me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Sword Coral Research Institute was situated in the province of Hainan. For every country, their underworld and mortal realm maps would be slightly different. In the underworld, there was a massive coral island that was around 70 to 80 square kilometers situated to the west of Hainan, and it was shaped like a sword.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ever since Qin Ye brought back the Omeyocan plan, construction had begun on the Sword Coral Research Institute, and only two years after the inner demon was slain was construction completed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The pristine white waves were crashing against the black rocks, and Qin Ye stood atop a rock with his hands clasped behind his back, looking out at the vast sea before him. \"It's underground?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zu Chongzhi smiled as he replied, \"We initially planned to construct the research institute above the ground, but there was too much noise from the sea, so we decided to construct it underground in the end.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, he pressed a palm down onto the ground, and a series of circles of Yin runes immediately began to spread over the ground like ripples. Several seconds later, the rocks split apart in all directions, and a hole that was around 100 meters in size was revealed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were a total of four staircases that were constructed from faux wood, each of which was at least 20 to 30 meters wide. On either side of the staircases were faux wood railings that were quite refined and antiquated in appearance, while the walls were riddled with reliefs, and they were naturally depicting the grand achievements of the third King Yanluo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye made his way down the staircase while inspecting his surroundings. During the past few years of development of the education industry, knowledge in Yin runology had become more prevalent, and it was beginning to show. For example, there was no need to walk down these staircases. Instead, they were like the automatic escalators that one would find in the shopping centers of the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, Zu Chongzhi was giving Qin Ye a report of the progress that had been made during the past two years. \"With the emergence of the new energy resource, space exploration technology has also been slowly progressing. Here, I must apologize for my incompetence. Even with the models of the mortal realm, we haven't been able to make much progress in the last two years.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye finally withdrew his gaze. At this point, they had already reached the bottom of the staircases, and ahead of them was a heavy black gate. There was a plaque that was over 20 meters in length hanging above the gate, and the words \"Sword Coral Research Institute\" were glowing with netherfire upon it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On either side of the gate were around a dozen Yin soldiers, and they immediately made a fist with their right hand before clasping it in front of the chest as a salute toward Qin Ye and Zu Chongzhi. Zu Chongzhi injected his Yin energy into the gate, and it slowly opened. Only then did Qin Ye ask, \"What's the problem?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the gate was a cavernous space. Computers still hadn't been developed yet, and up ahead was a front desk where 20 to 30 underworld emissaries were gathered. Behind the front desk was a relief of the Harken capturing ghosts, and the wooden badges of all of the departments were hanging on the wall. There were tables and chairs, screens, and all types of ornaments placed on either side to conceal the gates that led to different places.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zu Chongzhi walked along as he sighed, \"Space exploration in the mortal realm stems from astronomy, but we have no stars to observe.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He led Qin Ye through a gate, and the elevator beyond the gate rose up, quickly taking them to a giant platform.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a place with an abundance of advanced Yin runes. The area was roughly three kilometers in size, and the ground was a round platform constructed from white jade. At the center of the platform was a hole that was around 500 meters in size, and there was nothing in it. Working groups were gathered around the hole in an eight trigrams formation, and there were countless men in blue robes reading through documents in their respective positions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the platform was the vast and ethereal space. It was clear just from a single glance that no one aside from Zhao Yun could've torn open space like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The center of the platform is where the telescope is supposed to be,\" Zu Chongzhi explained. \"Professor Zhou, Professor Ma, please gather all of the professors of the working group here. Yanluo Qin is here for an inspection, so please raise any troubles and concerns that you have, and we'll try to work on some solutions.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Soon, around a dozen Yin spirits in black robes were gathered at the scene, and all of them were looking quite unkempt. Right after Zu Chongzhi introduced everyone, one of the professors immediately said, \"Your Excellency, there's no way for us to continue in our work unless we have access to a telescope!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is Professor Ma Xingchun from the materials department,\" Zu Chongzhi said, and he was just about to do some further explanation, but Qin Ye raised a hand to cut him off.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There's no need to explain anything. Scientists don't need to waste their time on appearances and formalities. Let's go and continue our discussion over there.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were many eight immortal tables beside the railing, and they were clearly meant to be places for the workers to gather and exchange ideas. As soon as they sat down, tea was immediately brought to them, but Ma Xingchun shook his head to refuse his cup of tea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that he had a lot to get off his chest, and as soon as they sat down, he immediately began. \"We've already completely memorized the Omeyocan plan that you brought to us, but the foundation of everything is the telescope.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response, indicating for him to continue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Without a telescope, we're unable to examine the special properties of the space of this plane. We can't determine whether there will be certain hazards, and we can't do things like calculate the degree of loss of gravity from the trajectories of the asteroids. Thus, there's no way for us to decide on what materials to use.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Isn't that all outlined in the Omeyocan plan?\" Qin Ye asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We can't just copy what's on the plan,\" another professor replied before Ma Xingchun could. \"Through our analysis, we discovered that the Omeyocan plan's spacecraft isn't suitable for our Cathayan Underworld. The design chosen for that spacecraft imitates a hermit crab, which is able to detach its shell at any point, but that was a decision made based on the special circumstances of the Usonian Underworld, and it's not something we can replicate. If we're going ahead with space exploration, then the entire nation must come together as one and pool its efforts together. Retreat cannot be an option! Hence, the design of our spacecraft will definitely have to be different. Truth be told, the material science and biology professors here have already proposed a better idea. On top of that, according to the information we were given, there will be Yin beasts in outer space. If we can trace their movement and determine from their special characteristics what properties are required to travel through space, then that'll allow us to make the best decision about how to proceed.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"What about the telescope? What requirements do you have for that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zu Chongzhi replied, \"During the past two years of research, we've managed to work out the concept behind the super telescope described in the Omeyocan plan. Following the demise of Yama-King level beings, their soul will dissipate, but their Yin energy will forever remain in their bones. They were able to infinitely extend the visual range of the telescope through Yin energy and Yin rune resonance. If we want to achieve the same thing, then we must use the bones of a Yama-King level Yin beast, and the only suitable thing we have at the moment is the Kraken. According to Ghost King Zhao's investigation, there are no longer any Yama-King level Yin beasts left in the Cathayan Underworld, and we're currently trying to make Prefect-level Yin beasts work, but we've performed over 20 experiments, and Prefect-level Yin energy is simply unable to achieve perfect resonance with advanced Yin runes. If we lower our standards, then the effectiveness of the telescope will be greatly discounted.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye set down his teacup before looking directly at the professors. \"Hypothetically speaking, if Hell can provide you with the remains of a Yama-King level being, how long will it take for you to build a super telescope?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"One year! No, eight months!\" All of the professors immediately stood up with fervent expressions upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had already had enough of this inability to make progress!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld was trying to develop space exploration technology, but they weren't able to do anything! During the past two years, they had already memorized the Omeyocan plan back to front, and they had become extremely frustrated by the limitations preventing them from making progress.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Back when the Sword Coral Research Institute was first founded, all of the work groups were constantly debating with one another. However, at this point, everyone spent all their time drinking tea and reading newspapers together, occasionally pulling out the Omeyocan plan, which everyone had already memorized, to&nbsp;see if they would be struck by any miraculous sense of inspiration.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Now that they were hearing what appeared to be a promise from Hell, they certainly weren't going to pass up this opportunity!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin Mountains Research Institute had already made progress in developing second-generation forbidden arts, how could they fall behind? The Ying Mountains Research Institute was constantly releasing progress reports and holding press conferences at all of the major academies, while the Sword Coral Research Institute was unable to release anything. How were they supposed to recruit people in the future?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye smiled as he rose to his feet. \"Please come with me, everyone.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The professors needed no further invitation, and Qin Ye vanished on the spot as a gust of Yin wind before reappearing beside the large hole at the center of the platform. All of the scientists hurriedly followed along, not wanting to waste even a second.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire scene had fallen completely silent, and even the scientists and trainees who were elsewhere in the room turned to see what was happening, wondering why the professors were so excited..</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The professors paid no heed to what everyone else was thinking. They were staring intently into the hole, wondering if it was finally time for their Sword Coral Research Institute to shine after two whole years of frustrating stagnation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ma Xingchun was so excited that his hands were trembling slightly, and everyone looked on intently as Qin Ye pulled out a small black ball.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ball was completely formed by Yin energy, and it was impossible to tell what it was. He gently crushed the ball in his hand, and in the next instant, a burst of vast Yin energy erupted over the entire area.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the tables and chairs on the entire platform trembled and swayed violently in the face of the fearsome shockwaves, and all of the scientists who were drinking tea immediately spilled their tea all over their own chests. However, no one paid any heed to that as their attention was focused entirely on Qin Ye and the professors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This is...

Even the palatial lanterns overhead had been plated with gold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In front of the scenic artwork at the center sat Qin Ye and Zhao Yun, while in front of them was a podium. The conference hall was 20 meters in both length and width, and it was already filled with Yin spirits.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"... Thus concludes our report for the past two years.\" At this moment, the middle-aged Yin spirit who was in the process of delivering his report at the front turned around before extending a respectful bow. A clerk immediately accepted his documents before presenting them to Qin Ye, who gave a slight nod, and only then did the middle-aged Yin spirit step down from the podium.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the department directors had already completed their reports, and the first thing that should be commended was that none of them were surprised by his return.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the directors had already grown accustomed to their King Yanluo's long absences.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Over the past dozen or so years, particularly following the establishment of the education industry, it had already become clear, even to the most clueless of underworld emissaries, that their King Yanluo was the main driving force behind the Cathayan Underworld's rapid development. As long as no one could stop him, the development of the Cathayan Underworld would also be completely unstoppable.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With undying souls, limitless time, and a complete cultivation system, this was a world that was completely different from the mortal realm, where nothing could be done in the absence of the main leader.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this world, time periods were counted in units of centuries.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye flipped over a page of the document, but even as his gaze was roaming over the page, his thoughts were elsewhere.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second thing that was quite encouraging was that during the past two years, the Cathayan Underworld had experienced a period of rapid growth. GDP was rising steadily, and the massive revenue from the new energy resource base stations and all of the patents held by the Cathayan Underworld was a much-needed injection of funds into the economy. Everything was progressing in a very positive direction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thirdly, the military had adapted very positively despite the deaths of over 300,000 troops during the Battle of Zhuolu. The retired Yin soldiers had either entered the cycle of reincarnation, or had been given extensive benefits to ensure that they lived out comfortable lives. All of the Yin soldiers from that battle who remained in the military were being groomed as leaders, and they were extremely sought-after by all of the military branches.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With the model of development from the mortal realm, all that the Cathayan Underworld had to do was replicate the model, so it didn't make much difference whether Qin Ye was absent or not.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, he cleared his throat, and all of the directors down below immediately sat up straighter. \"Thank you for your hard work, everyone. You've all done very well during my absence. Your contributions were imperative to allowing our Cathayan Underworld to develop to this stage from such humble beginnings.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He picked up his teacup as he smiled and continued, \"However, there are two experts here who aren't directors that are also in attendance, and I want to hear what they think.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had already made a decision about how to proceed, but this was quite a significant step that could affect the state of the entire world. Thus, it was best to introduce the idea more gradually so that everyone could be mentally prepared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the directors immediately turned their attention toward the two seats down below.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were President Lu Ban of the Yin Mountains State-run Research Institute, and President Zu Chonghzi of the Sword Coral State-run Research Center.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lu Ban hesitated momentarily before standing up and cupping his fist in a salute. \"Your Excellency, do you want to do this right now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A slightly portly man with a head of white hair turned to Lu Ban with a faint smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the director of the ministry of revenue, Zhang Kangliang.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The <span style=\"; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">Sword Coral&nbsp;</span>State-run Research Center had been officially founded after the Omeyocan plan was obtained. No one knew what they were researching, but Zhang Kangliang knew that every year, the two state-run research institutes were given 150 billion in funding!

It was clear that Qin Ye had entrusted them with a secret task. Otherwise, there was no way that all of the directors would be oblivious to what they had been researching.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course.\" Qin Ye nodded with a smile. \"Could it be that you don't trust these colleagues of yours?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of amused laughter rang out, but Lu Ban and Zu Chongzhi didn't join in. Instead, their brows furrowed even tighter.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course they trusted these colleagues, but if this plan were to be announced, there would be no going back!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was going to be a war between nations on the horizon!

With King Yanluo's Seal at our disposal, we'll undoubtedly be able to go further in forbidden arts research than other underworlds, and we estimate that second-generation forbidden arts will be developed within the next 10 years.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Deathly silence.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the officials in the hall turned toward Lu Ban upon hearing this before quickly looking away again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhang Kangliang gulped nervously as he cast a surreptitiously glance at Qin Ye.

However, there's more to it than that. Our Cathayan Underworld possesses a brilliant resource in the form of the Cathayan population. As more time passes, the population of our Cathayan Underworld will grow exponentially. The new energy resource has smashed open the gate to the new era for us, and with each passing year, our labor force and wealth of skilled personnel will continue to be bolstered by the mortal realm. This is our main advantage. Furthermore, the education system in Cathay has its flaws, but it's undeniable that Cathay has the most complete universal education in the world. This is actually beneficial for us as the highly skilled personnel from the mortal realm have to forget everything they've learned and start again from scratch after entering the underworld, while less specialized individuals are able to accept these changes more quickly. Of course, the Hindustani Underworld also has the same advantage. However, the caste system is present for Hindustan in both the mortal realm and the underworld, and their degree of universal education is far inferior to ours. Thus, in terms of netherworldly citizen procurement rate and the level of general education, we have a crushing advantage over the other three pillars.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"In that case, why is it that everything, from the conference in Nara to the new energy resource press conference, has been so difficult for us? Why is it that only after the new energy resource was released, the construction of all of the base stations were completed, electricity was supplied to the entire world, and our currency was tied to the new energy resource that all of the other underworlds sided themselves with us? In fact, even now, some of them are still a little undecided in their stance toward us.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if a scripted exchange were taking place between Qin Ye and Zhao Yun, but all of the officials present knew that this conversation was going to decide the future direction of the Cathayan Underworld, so they had to listen and observe carefully.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun heaved a faint sigh in response. \"It's because our Cathayan Underworld hasn't yet displayed its power since we opened ourselves up to the rest of the world, and because of that, all of the other underworlds are doubting us! If we had attended the conference in Nara with the Yama-Kings of the 10 Palaces and the Sixfold Ghost Kings, none of them would've dared to plot against us.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face as he turned toward everyone else in the room. \"In that case, how do you all propose we can display to the rest of the world as quickly as possible that we've already returned to the height of our powers? Alternatively, even if we haven't, how do we ensure that they wouldn't dare to plot against us again?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one said anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The answer was very clear: second-generation forbidden arts!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, in order to display the forbidden arts to the world, it would have to be detonated, and where was that going to happen?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In contrast with the nuclear weapons of the mortal realm, the forbidden arts of the underworld were sealed within molds, and after detonating one, even a Yama-King would have to rest and recuperate for quite some time. Furthermore, the mold containing the forbidden art would immediately be scrapped.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All carrier molds were constructed from rare and precious materials, so they were extremely expensive. It could be said that every single carrier mold was a work of art, and with such extravagant costs involved, there was no way they could just detonate one of the forbidden arts for the viewing pleasure of other nations.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only way to prove that the Cathayan Underworld had returned to its peak would be to detonate one in another underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this instant, all of the officials finally understood what Qin Ye's true intentions were, and they looked up toward the podium in unison with intense looks in their eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The nation was about to go to war!</span></p>"

It wasn't that they didn't want to move, they were simply too incredulous to move. A few seconds later, a string of loud neighs rang out as several hundred warhorses descended from the vast expanse of Yin clouds with Yin energy swirling all around them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What are those idiots doing?!

With a flick of his finger, Zhou Yu released a messenger bird that was holding an image capture crystal with its beak. It was also at this exact moment that the two Abyssal Prefects abruptly vanished on the spot.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Retreat!\" Zhou Yu yelled without any hesitation, swiveling around on his skeletal warhorse to rush back the same way he had come from. All of the Yin soldiers under his command instantly dispersed like mercury and fled in all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're not going anywhere!\" One of the Abyssal Prefects resembled a log with tree bark all over its entire body. It had a very thin build, and its tattered black cloak was like a piece of clothing hanging out to dry on a clothesline. In the instant that the 11 envoys dispersed, the Abyssal Prefect thrust a palm down toward the ground, and a series of wilted vines erupted out of the ground like giant dragons rising up out of the sea, pouncing directly toward the underworld emissaries.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Standing atop the sea of vines was the other Abyssal Prefect, who had a short and stubby build with deathly pale flesh that was riddled with holes. The second Abyssal Prefect brought its palms together, and flowers began to bloom on the wilted vines, producing countless skulls that were burning with scorching netherfire. A menacing smile appeared on the second Abyssal Prefect's face, following which it snapped its fingers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">BOOM!!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An inky-black shockwave abruptly swept through the entire space, and countless specks of netherfire were sent flying in all directions. Amid the violent explosion, both of the Abyssal Prefects cast their eyes toward a certain direction with their eyes wide with astonishment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They didn't die?

Upon calculating the area covered by the Yin cloud circle, it would be very easy to determine where the center was, and that was where the inner demon was situated.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The wood-like Abyssal Prefect didn't hesitate in the slightest as it thrust both of its palms down toward the ground, and a black forest of wilted trees erupted out of the ground, forming a barricade all around them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no way that the arrows would be able to pierce through the forest, but right as they were about to plunge into the forest, a string of dull thumps rang out from the Yin clouds, and several hundred fiery birds flew out behind the arrows.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the arrows were instantly set alight before plunging into the forest, and what was extremely peculiar was that these flames seemed to be alive!

The Yin energy of the Abyssal Prefect was rapidly chipping away at his courage, but he still looked forward with a determined expression, and the netherfire in his eyes had turned bright red.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!\" he roared with all his might, as if he were trying to dispel the fear in his heart, then pressed his own body tightly against the back of his steed as he charged toward the wood-like Abyssal Prefect at full speed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The skeletal warhorse was instantly erased out of existence, and reddish-black Yin energy began to seep out of Gao Changgong's&nbsp;soul, which was on the verge of disintegrating. The metal visor covering his face also shattered, revealing his outrageously handsome features.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His long black hair danced wildly in the wind, yet the resolve in his eyes didn't waver even in the slightest.

Immediately thereafter, the inner demon stabbed a finger forward, and a beam of black light shot directly toward Gao Changgong's glabella.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The attack was truly as fast as lightning!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The inner demon hadn't unleashed power beyond the Yama-King level.

Having waited for this day for so long, he was so excited that even his hands were trembling slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After setting down his teacup, he took another deep breath before continuing, \"The two branches are the Amatsukami and the Kunitsukami, and they are collectively known as the eight million gods.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Eight million?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's expression changed slightly upon hearing this. That was truly a massive number. This was the foundation of an underworld that had existed for thousands of years. Generations upon generations of Yin spirits added up to form a formidable army, yet the Nipponese Underworld was only a third-rate underworld, so one could only imagine just how fearsome the other three pillars were.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Among the eight million gods, four million belong to the Amatsukami, while the other four million belong to the Kunitsukami. If we instigate this war with the intention of conquering the Nipponese Underworld, their Heaven won't just stand by and watch Amano-Iwato fall. If Amano-Iwato is conquered, the reincarnated people will become people of the Cathayan&nbsp;Underworld. In 50, maybe 100 years, after all of the Nipponese People have gone through reincarnation, the Nipponese Underworld would truly become the territory of the Cathayan Underworld, and its religion would also naturally become the Cathayan Underworld's religion. No independent nation would be willing to become a subsidiary to another underworld. Hence, not only will we be facing the Nipponese Underworld in this war, we'll also be facing its gods!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This entailed an army of eight million, and a grim look appeared on Qin Ye's face as he nodded in response, indicating for Qin Changxin to continue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Even after we develop second-generation forbidden arts, we'll only be able to attack the Kunitsukami, while the Amatsukami are in the mythical Takamagahara, which is the equivalent to the Cathayan Underworld's Heaven. They will remain unaffected, and they'll most likely form the bulk of the resistance that we'll have to face. As for the leaders of the Amatsukami, perhaps you've heard of them. They are Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi. Of course, just like Izanami, they're also only Abyssal Prefects. The Amatsukami and the Kunituskami have historically had a rocky relationship, having gone to war against each other many times, but we have to expect that they would set aside their differences to oppose us as one.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He waved a hand through the air, and a map of Nippon appeared. However, it was a map of ancient Nippon, rather than one of modern Nippon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Coincidentally, ancient Nippon was heavily influenced by Cathayan culture, leading to the nation being split up into eight regions, namely Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kansai, Chugoku, Kyushu, and Shikoku.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin tapped on the Kansai region, then moved his finger to the Shikoku region as he said, \"I haven't been to Takamagahara, but it's said that Takamagahara is situated in the spirit realm in the sky above Kyoto, which is in the Kansai region. In other words, that is the stronghold of the Amatsukami, whereas Shikoku is the stronghold of the Kunitsukami. However, the so-called demons and deities of Nippon cannot even begin to compare with those of Cathay. As I'm sure you're aware, the foundations of all underworlds stem from the myths and worship of the mortal realm. The system of demons and deities in Taoism is far more vast than anything the Nipponese Underworld has to offer. Nippon believes in the Shinto religion, and the mantra of the religion is that all things have spirits. This concept gave rise to evil ghosts such as Futakuchi-onna, Sadako Yamamura, and Kayako Saeki, as well as many demonic entities. In Nippon, there's no clear distinction between demons and ghosts. This concept that all things have spirits have resulted in the emergence of some inexplicable ghosts and deities. For example, if a chair were to develop a spirit, it would become one of the Kunitsukami. The same would apply if an umbrella developed a spirit. Among the four million Kunitsukami, there are even deities such as the slipper god and the door god, which would only be the lowliest of underworld emissaries in the Cathayan Underworld. Hence, there won't be much resistance coming from the Kunitsukami.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he wanted to make a move against the Nipponese Underworld, then he naturally had to understand their power system first. Essentially, the so-called four million Kunitsukami were like the popular computer game \"Nobunaga's Ambition\". Each of the names of their attacks was flashier than the previous one, but in reality, they were all quite underwhelming, such as 1,000 people thrusting bamboo spears at an enemy...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, in reality, the power of the four million Kunitsukami was downright pitiful. The Amatsukami were most likely going to be more powerful, but definitely not by much. Thus, knowing full well that the overall quality was severely lacking, they could only make up for that with numbers, gathering all of the demons and ghosts, even things such as slipper ghosts and umbrella ghosts, thereby forming an army of four million.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, a faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face. Now that he thought about it, he had met the leader of the Kunitsukami before. It was none other than Susanoo-no-Mikoto.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His son's name was Susa Boy, who had split up into two entities, namely Crow Tengu and Black Yaksha, after suffering from a split personality. After that ill-advised trip that it took to the Cathayan Underworld, it had never returned.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, another one of Nippon's three great yokai, Otakemaru, was also in his Dusk Legionnaire. Qin Ye nodded toward Qin Changxin as he said, \"You've provided a very detailed rundown of the situation in Nippon, Director Qin. Where do you propose we should strike from?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I say we strike from Hokkaido!\" Qin Changxin replied in a confident voice. \"Amano-Iwato is situated under present-day Kyoto, which means that there are virtually no troops stationed in Tohoku and Hokkaido. If we choose to begin our invasion there, we'll be able to force them into a battle in the Chubu or Kansai region. Thus, they'll be forced to gather all of their troops, and that will be where the second-generation forbidden art can achieve the best effect.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were all things that had to be done prior to instigating the war. A strategy had to be devised, and corresponding preparations had to be made. For example, if they decided to begin their invasion from Tohoku and Hokkaido, then they would have to begin&nbsp;training their navy and building ports and ships at the Strait of Tsushima. Furthermore, the production chains would also have to begin to lean toward the three eastern provinces, which were going to support the invading army.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were major moves that had to be made over the course of years, so planning had to begin right away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. It was time to call up all of the high-ranking officials of the three eastern provinces for a meeting. At the same time, it was about time that he summoned Liu Yu and made an example out of him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they were going to invade from Tohoku, then Daehan and the Strait of Tsushima had to be firmly within his control.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just as Qin Ye was about to bring the meeting to a conclusion, Qin Changxin suddenly asked, \"Your Excellency, have you thought about how you're going to rule over Amano-Iwato after you conquer it?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was rather taken aback by this question, and he smiled as he replied, \"Rest assured, Director Qin. Our Cathayan Underworld had 12 envoys during ancient times, and there's no reason why we can't instate a new set of 12 envoys. Our Cathayan Underworld has many subsidiary nations, so we'll need to at least assign three frontier governors, and you'll be the first one.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't even have to think about the other two, they were definitely going to be Yu Qian and Yang Jiye. He would rather split the Southern Asian islands between the two than send out more envoys.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once Amano-Iwato was conquered, the defense chain of the entire Cathayan Underworld would be complete, and the Cathayan Underworld would be protected from all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Qin Changxin shook his head in response. \"I've never doubted your promise to me, Your Excellency. However, what I'm saying is that Amano-Iwato is an underworld that has stood for over 2,000 years, and its power is certainly not just limited to the Amatsukami and the Kunitsukami. There will also be the Minakanushi and the national protective array, which will take at least one or two months to bypass. During this time, the netherworldly citizens of Amano-Iwato will definitely revolve. In addition to that, we'll be facing pressure from the three pillars, and the situation will undoubtedly become extremely chaotic. Under those circumstances, how can we continue to make stable progress?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye hadn't thought about this yet. He didn't want to have to do something as heinous as engaging in mass slaughter. The Cathayan Underworld needed the Nipponese Underworld's territory, but it would certainly also receive a significant boost from the Nipponese Underworld's netherworldly citizens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they were to kill the entire population of the Nipponese Underworld, then they would have to start from square one, just like when the new Hell was being established all those years ago.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What are your thoughts?\" Qin Ye asked.

If someone in Amano-Iwato with a lofty status were willing to accept us and help us stabilize the situation, that would be ideal, would it not?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course!\" Qin Ye immediately replied. \"Who are you referring to?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Do you still remember the old man who was on that boat with us several years ago?\" Qin Changxin asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes immediately lit up upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That man was the current owner of the Mitsubishi Corporation!

At this moment, the doors of the room were tightly shut, and different types of fruits and intricate snacks had been carefully arranged on the eight immortal table at the center of the room. Including Liu Yu, there were four men seated around the table.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were Chu Linh Thạch, Thẩm Điền Tử, and Vương Trấn Ác.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Take a look for yourself.\" Liu Yu tossed the imperial edict onto the table like a dirty rag, causing the jade plates that were carrying the fruits and snacks to clatter loudly. Chu Linh Thạch raised an eyebrow as he took the imperial edict before taking a look, upon which a grim look also appeared on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What does it say?\" Thẩm Điền Tử and Vương Trấn Ác asked in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Chu Linh Thạch offered no reply. Instead, he picked up his teacup with tightly furrowed brows before taking a sip.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meanwhile, a cold smile appeared on Liu Yu's face as he stroked his own beard. \"That rascal in Everburn is summoning me to see him.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a full five seconds of silence, Thẩm Điền Tử asked in a surprised voice, \"That's it?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's it!\" Liu Yu suddenly slammed the table, and all of the teacups were almost knocked over.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire room fell silent again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In any dynasty, Thẩm Điền Tử, Vương Trấn Ác, and Chu Linh Thạch would've been considered to be top-tier warriors. They were completely ruthless and fearless in battle, yet in this moment, all three of them had fallen into an uneasy silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several seconds later, Chu Linh Thạch heaved a forlorn sigh. \"The times have changed, Your Excellency. Yanluo Qin is no longer the same pushover he once was. Following the past 20 years of development, the Cathayan Underworld has reached great heights once again. It's time that we bowed our heads to him.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He looked up at the palatial lantern overhead, which was antiquated in style, but was giving off electrical light. \"Ever since the new energy resource was released to the world, even the three pillars have abandoned the idea of trying to knock down the Cathayan Underworld. With each base station that's set up, their relationship with the Cathayan Underworld grows closer and closer. The times have well and truly changed, Your Excellency.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Liu Yu didn't say anything, and only after a long while did he heave a long sigh. \"Did I make a mistake?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Not necessarily,\" Vương Trấn Ác signed. \"Under those circumstances, who wouldn't have been tempted to claim some territory for themselves? The only mistake we made was that we weren't decisive enough, and it certainly didn't help that Yu Qian and Yang Jiye had to mess with our plans. Also, Hell was far more decisive than we anticipated. After the imperial court meeting, they used new weapons to establish a brief and fragile relationship of mutual benefit with us, thereby causing us to miss the ideal opportunity, and after that, they immediately took down Ashmound. At that point, it was already too late for us. Then came the intervention of the second King Yanluo and the return of Ghost King Zhao, and all of that took place within a span of just three years. Everything changed in those three short years...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He heaved a faint sigh and shook his head as he fell silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the room fell into silence again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, Liu Yu opened his mouth to speak. \"There's no point in dwelling on the past. What should we do about this imperial edict?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Chu Linh Thạch's brows were tightly furrowed as he asked, \"Are you worried that he'll exact vengeance on you?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on Liu Yu's face as he replied, \"The third King Yanluo is definitely not one to just forget about grudges. Have you still not figured that out at this point? He's much more able to swallow humiliation than the second King Yanluo, but whenever he's chosen to strike back, I can't think of an instance where he's failed. To be honest, I'm not afraid of the second King Yanluo. At least with him, you always know what's coming. However, there's no way to tell what the third King Yanluo is thinking, and if he does choose to strike you down, he'll make sure to do it in one fell swoop.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He picked up his teacup as if he wanted to take a sip, but set it down without doing so in the end. \"Zhou Gongjin, Wang Meng, and the others pledged their loyalty to him even before us, but what happened to them? They were still essentially banished to grassroots units for over 10 years. No one in the nation was even aware of where those renowned historic figures were! If they hadn't put their lives on the line during the Battle of Zhuolu, they'd still be toiling away with no reward for the foreseeable future. If I accept this summons...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His fists clenched up tightly as the silken tablecloth bunched up in his hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Am I walking to my own execution?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire imperial edict only consisted of a single sentence, but that only made it all the more unsettling.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Perhaps we can defect to the Nipponese Underworld,\" Thẩm Điền Tử murmured. \"We've interacted quite frequently with them over the past century.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you an idiot?\" Vương Trấn Ác snapped. \"Do you think the armies of the three eastern provinces are just there for show? Why do you think Qin Hui was assigned to the three eastern provinces? The economic center of the Cathayan Underworld lies on the coastline in cities like Ashmound and the City of Salvation! Why would an Abyssal Prefect like Qin Hui have been sent to the three eastern provinces instead of those places? I'm willing to bet that if we display any intention of defecting to the Nipponese Underworld at all, we'll be dead before we know it! There's no way we'd be able to get past the Strait of Tsushima! Also, how do you plan to pass through the Array of the Nine Gods? We were connected to the Nipponese Underworld through Otakemaru, but Otakemaru has been missing for decades!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the heated conversation, Liu Yu remained silent, and only after a full minute had passed did he heave a resigned sigh. \"I will be traveling to Everburn to meet Yanluo Qin in three weeks. Prior to that, gather all of the documents detailing our dealings with the Nipponese Underworld in preparation for the meeting.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">………………………………………………..</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Cathayan Underworld, six paths of reincarnation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a certain section of the six paths of reincarnation with a long corridor that was 10 meters wide, and the walls were lined with lanterns in the shape of the Pixiu Chimera's head. Furthermore, there were Yin soldiers stationed along the corridor at five-step intervals.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no sound whatsoever, and one wouldn't even be able to tell if the heavily armored Yin soldiers were dead or alive if not for the netherfire burning in their eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A group of red-robed servants drifted onto the ground in a respectful manner, and Qin Ye was situated at the center of the ground with his hands clasped behind his back, flying atop a Yin cloud.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There seemed to be no end to the corridor, and the monotonous scenery gave one a sense that the path was constantly repeating. Aside from the round halls that appeared once every kilometer, it was as if one had entered the world of reincarnation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, 15 minutes later, what appeared up ahead was a giant gate as opposed to another round hall. The gate was 20 meters tall and 15 meters wide, and the left half of the gate carried a relief of the Harken, while the right bore the design of the Pixiu chimera. At the center was an extremely complex Lu Ban lock with a total of 32 rods.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arthis was already standing beside the Lu Ban lock, and her brows furrowed slightly at the sight of Qin Ye. \"What brings you here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye waved a dismissive hand, and the servants on either side of him immediately departed, leaving only him and Arthis behind. He gently stroked the gate as he said, \"I had always heard that the safest of cities had the most secure of prisons, and it seems that this place is a perfect example.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"... I'm sorry, but this place is not a prison, it's called the Nine Dragon Abyss, and it doesn't have anything to do with the safety of the city. By the way, when are you going to be able to develop internet? I bet my Diamond rank account has already fallen off!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Do you have to be so boring?! Can't you just humor me for once?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye cast a disdainful gaze toward Arthis.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the downside of having too much power. There was simply no one that he could confide in anymore.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Open the gate!\" Qin Ye snapped. He couldn't even find anyone to fool around with anymore, and it was a little disheartening.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I guess I can't have everything...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The extremely complex 32-rod Lu Ban lock slowly opened up in front of Qin Ye, revealing an icy world beyond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was white netherfire everywhere, and the area was lit by massive candles. Down the center was a massive path, either side of which was lined by lanterns crafted in the shape of the heads of Hell's divine beasts, and they were all burning with netherfire. Qin Ye knew that if any urgent situations were to arise, those flames would immediately erupt to transform this place into a sea of fire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were reincarnation karmic flames, flames of an even higher caliber than hellish karmic flames, and any being below the Infernal Judge level would be instantly killed on contact.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On either side of the path were a total of 10 gates, every single one of which was forged from A-grade ore, ensuring that they were absolutely soundproof and devoid of any gaps.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was like the most secure prison in the Cathayan Underworld, and unless Arthis opened these gates in person, there was no other way to open them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no one here, nor any light present. If anyone were to be locked into this place, then they would have to face eternal darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was here to see someone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Arthis opened the fourth cell on the left, a room with lavish decor was revealed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The room was around 100 square meters in size, and it was constructed in an antiquated Cathayan style. Inside the room was a person reading a book in silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">To be more accurate, it was a spirit.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His physical body was already gone, and all that remained was a pale, shadow-like soul. All alone in this spacious room, it seemed like an extremely lonely existence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A thin silver chain was locked around each of his four limbs, and the chains were very long, allowing him to move freely throughout the entire room. He seemed to have a decent degree of freedom, but all those well-versed in material sciences would be able to identify the material of the chains as spirit vanquishing rock. Even a Yama-King wouldn't be able to break free from these chains.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long time no see, Mr. Xu,\" Qin Ye said.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xu Fu flipped over a page in his book, then nodded with a calm expression. \"Indeed. Take a seat.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three of them sat down at the eight immortal table at the center of the room, and Xu Fu said, \"The books you sent me this time are quite good. Next time, please send me the Twenty-Four Histories. I'm planning to rewrite the history of Cathay.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm glad to hear it,\" Qin Ye replied with a faint smile. \"Have you been well, Mr. Xu.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I have, thank you for asking,\" Xu Fu chuckled. \"I'm surprised you still remember someone like me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After the second King Yanluo searched Xu Fu's soul, he didn't destroy it. However, the soul was incomplete, so it was impossible for Xu Fu to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Otherwise, Qin Ye wouldn't have allowed such a ticking time bomb to remain in the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nine Dragon Abyss was the ideal place for him to stay, in his current form, Xu Fu wouldn't be able to stray far away from the six paths of reincarnation even if he were released.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Do you need something from me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I do,\" Qin Ye said as he looked straight into Xu Fu's eyes. \"I have a question. How familiar are you with Amano-Iwato?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xu Fu's expression changed slightly upon hearing this. \"Could it be that you're planning to take down Izanami?!\"</span></p>"

If it weren't for their historic reputations, there was no way that the 12 envoys would've been able to live here. Even so, they were still only able to live not far from where the road began.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Liu Yu lowered the curtain of the carriage before heaving a faint sigh. \"Let's go.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency, all of your past colleagues are avoiding you! If we go back like this and Yanluo Qin decides to punish us for our transgressions, there won't even be anyone to intercede for us!\" Thẩm Điền Tử said in a grim voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Do you think meeting them will improve our situation?\" Liu Yu snapped. \"They're barely able to keep themselves afloat, what makes you think they would be willing and able to help us?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After many days of intense emotional stress, Liu Yu finally cracked. \"I only came here to see if I could find a way out, but I always knew the chances were slim. Now that our final shred of hope has been dashed, let's just face reality and accept our fate.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He closed his eyes as he spoke, but his eyelids were trembling slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He heaved a long sigh as he leaned back against his seat while stroking a red wooden box, and after a long silence, he finally instructed, \"Take us to the North Yin Pavilion.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thẩm Điền Tử, Vương Trấn Ác, and Chu Linh Thạch's eyelids twitched slightly upon hearing this, and Chu Linh Thạch gulped nervously as he said, \"If we give that box to Yanluo Qin, our deaths will be sealed.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That may be true, but at the very least, we'll have a chance of being allowed to reincarnate,\" Liu Yu said in a cold voice. \"Alternatively, are you under the impression that we'll be allowed to live anyway?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone fell silent, and the carriage turned a corner before heading straight toward the North Yin Pavilion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Liu Yu wants to see me?\" Qin Ye asked as looked up from the document that he was reading. \"Where is he right now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"He's waiting at the front desk,\" Wang Chenghao replied. \"Would you like to see him now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Let him wait. Tell him that I'm busy.\" Qin Ye lowered his head to continue reading the document, yet right as Wang Chenghao was about to leave, he suddenly said, \"Yu Qian and Yang Jiye are currently in Everburn for a debriefing at the moment, right? Get them to come and see me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wang Chenghao quickly departed, and shortly thereafter, Yu Qian and Yang Jiye arrived before extending a bow in unison. \"Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was their reward for choosing the correct side.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">While Zhou Yu and the others were still toiling away in grassroots units, Yu Qian and Yang Jiye had been allowed to keep their former territory and had even been granted the entirety of Southern Asia! One of them had been assigned with the duty of keeping an eye on the Hindustani Underworld to the east, while the other was overseeing the Strait of Tsushima.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were two extremely important locations, and only the most trusted of subordinates would've been assigned such duties.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Take a seat,\" Qin Ye said with a smile as he made an inviting hand gesture.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tea was immediately brought on by the servants, and as Yu Qian picked up his teacup, the refreshing fragrance of tea wafted into his nostrils, upon which his eyes immediately lit up. \"This is some fine tea!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We've already prepared some for you to take with you if you like,\" Qin Ye replied with a smile, then took a sip of his own tea before cutting straight to the chase. \"Liu Yu is here.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yang Jiye's smile faded upon hearing this, and he asked, \"What do you plan to do with him, Your Excellency?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye looked down at his teacup as he replied, \"He's already mentally prepared for what's coming to him. I've finally summoned him to see me for the first time in over 20 years, and I'm sure he knows there's no reason why I would spare his life. On top of that, we're preparing for war against the Nipponese Underworld, so I have to recover the Hanyang Underworld. Originally, my plan was to kill him in the presence of all of the envoys, but I've changed my mind now. He came here even though he knows that his death is inevitable, so he must be trying to salvage what little reputation and honor he can. Under these circumstances, if I were to grant him the death sentence, the impact that it would have on the other envoys wouldn't be quite as potent. On top of that, Liu Yu is quite a capable warrior, so it would be a pity to kill him.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, Liu Yu was someone who had once almost united the entirety of Cathay, and there certainly weren't many people in history who could boast the same achievement.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"But Your Excellency, sparing him would compromise your authority!\" Yu Qian immediately countered. \"There have been countless brilliant individuals throughout history, but if Hell chooses not to use them, they'll be complete nobodies! Xiang Yu was every bit the warrior that Liu Yu was, if not more, but after entering the underworld, he was unwilling to work with Liu Bang, and he threatened King Yanluo at the time to try and get his way. As a result, he was banished from the military and never heard from again. Why should Liu Yu receive special treatment?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I disagree.\" To Qin Ye's surprise, Yang Jiye offered an objection before he could. \"The events that you described took place during the reign of the first King Yanluo, where he had a vast abundance of powerful warriors under his command, so Xiang Yu was entirely disposable. In contrast, it would indeed be a pity to kill Liu Yu under these circumstances.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After expressing their opinions, neither of them said anything further, and they both turned to Qin Ye for his opinion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a few minutes of contemplation, Qin Ye concluded, \"He definitely must be killed, but depending on his performance, he can perhaps redeem himself. If he proves himself to be useful, I'm willing to send him to the path of the beast to be reincarnated for three lifetimes before returning to serve Hell. If the opposite is true, then I wouldn't mind sending an extra passenger to Black Yaksha's paper flower boat. Servants, summon Liu Yu to see me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This wasn't the first time that Liu Yu had entered the North Yin Pavilion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had been here on a previous occasion many years ago, but since then, the world had changed rapidly and left him far behind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He followed a servant into the pavilion, walking over the red carpet in the resplendent long corridor. Along the way, he was greeted by the sight of the occasional passing group of palatial maidens carrying platters that were laden with all types of delicacies and fine wines. Countless chaotic thoughts were flashing through his mind, but he was brought back to reality by the voice of the servant. \"We're here, Master Liu.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Up ahead was an open redwood door with extremely life-like reliefs of the Aurogon engraved upon it. Beyond the door was a series of giant red pillars carved in the form of coiled dragons, and a figure was seated on a golden throne at the center of the spacious room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was giving off a vast tsunami-like aura that could only belong to an advanced Yama-King, and Liu Yu heaved a long sigh before making his way into the room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as he entered the room, the door was gently closed behind him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire palace was very quiet, so much so that even a pin drop would be audibly heard, and the only sound came from the occasional sips of tea taken by Yu Qian and Yang Jiye. Liu Yu gritted his teeth tightly, then fell to his knees before kowtowing heavily to the ground. \"I am here to atone for my crimes.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was humiliation of the highest order.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was an emperor who had once come close to uniting Cathay, yet he was forced to kowtow to the emperor of the underworld, and in the instant that his forehead made contact with the carpet, his expression was slightly twisted from shame.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of his pride faded away like the wind with this gesture.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was still no sound.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's overwhelming Yin energy was flowing through the palace as if it had substantial form, and Liu Yu didn't dare to raise his head. Only after several seconds had passed did he hear a calm voice. \"What crimes do you have to atone for?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A myriad of emotions were surging through Liu Yu's heart as he replied, \"I have committed too many transgressions to count! Threatening Hell with the Hanyang Dynasty is a crime of disloyalty! Raising my troops against Everburn is a crime of insubordination, and refusing to yield even as the other envoys conceded is a crime of sin! I deserve nothing but the severest of punishments, but I implore that you give me the opportunity to redeem myself!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was being very open and honest. Then again, in this situation, he didn't dare to hide anything. A reminiscent look appeared in Qin Ye's eyes as he stared at Liu Yu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Back when he was at the most difficult stage of his tenure as King Yanluo, the 12 envoys had seemed like insurmountable obstacles, but since then, all of them had been forced to concede to him one after another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is that all of the crimes that you have to atone for?\" Qin Ye asked as he took a sip of tea. \"Have a good, hard think. Is there anything else of particular importance that you've neglected to mention?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Yin spirits could sweat, Liu Yu would already be drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course there was!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had colluded with Izanami and the Russian Underworld to betray the Cathayan Underworld! This was the severest of all of his transgressions!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't dare to reveal this. As one of the former 12 envoys, he knew just how cruel the laws of Hell were. Furthermore, with the emergence of the Reincarnation King, the 18 abysses of punishment had most likely also been completed, and just the thought of that was enough to make his skin crawl.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even those as mighty as Su Daji and Qin Hui didn't dare to oppose Hell after entering the 18 abysses of punishment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't dare to answer, but that didn't mean that everyone was going to wait patiently for him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Hurry up!\" Yu Qian prompted. \"Yanluo Qin has asked you a question. As his subordinate, you are obligated to reply!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I... I...\" Liu Yu was beginning to tremble at this point, and he kowtowed once again as he said, \"My crimes are too heinous to be mentioned, but I ask for an opportunity to redeem myself! From now on, I will put my life on the line and fight for Hell wherever you see fit!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only way he could beg for a sliver of an opportunity for redemption for himself was to rely on his prowess as a warrior, and that only further exacerbated his humiliation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Too heinous to be mentioned?\" Qin Ye repeated in an indifferent voice. \"Don't worry, the worst that could happen to you is to be sent to the 18 abysses of punishment. Do you think I wouldn't send you there as long as you don't admit to your crimes? Just the crime of raising your army against the City of Salvation alone warrants the death sentence by a hundredfold!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slammed the table as he abruptly rose to his feet. \"In the wake of the old Hell's demise, everyone was fully dedicated to building the new Hell. You were the only subordinates that I could rely on at the time, yet what did you do?! You tried to usurp me!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He made his way over to Liu Yu and looked intently down at him. \"This is your last chance, Liu Yu. Tell me what else you did. If you display enough sincerity, I can consider not putting you through 10 lifetimes of reincarnation as a punishment!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the final straw that broke the camel's back, and Liu Yu's psychological defenses were instantly destroyed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Prior to coming here, he had thought of countless excuses and countless ways that he could try to weasel his way out of punishment, but only now did he realize that there was no chance for negotiation at all in the face of absolute power.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He raised his hands above his head, offering a red wooden box to Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"These are the records of everything I've done over the past century, including who I've come into contact with, how I contacted them, and all of the information I managed to gather on those people. All I ask is that you give me an opportunity to redeem myself, Yanluo Qin...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes finally lit up upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was exactly what he wanted!</span></p>"

It had to be said that he was extremely handsome and refined in appearance. This expression would make anyone else appear sinister and sleazy, but it had an entirely different effect on him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to reply, Arthis suddenly said, \"Do you really want to stay here for the rest of your life?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xu Fu immediately turned toward Arthis upon hearing this, and only after a long while did he shift his gaze away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instead of speaking right away, he began to tap the surface of the table with his fingers, and several minutes later, he smiled as he said, \"The situation in the East Cathay Sea actually isn't all that complex.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a decision that he couldn't take lightly. He knew that even though Qin Ye hadn't promised him any reward in exchange for this information, it would be extremely unwise of him to lie to Qin Ye in his current state. Furthermore, there was no way that the Nipponese Underworld would be able to withstand an attack from several Yama-Kings anyway, so there was no reason for him to lie.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Many years ago, I constructed Fantasy City using the seabed passageway. Due to the geographic location, the first party that I had to contact was the Nipponese Underworld.\" He smiled as he continued, \"I'm not afraid to admit that I was constantly prepared to have to make my escape at the time, and the first direction I considered was naturally to go toward the east. The Nipponese Underworld wouldn't accept me as they feared the wrath of the Cathayan Underworld, but at the very least, they wouldn't be able to stop me from entering the new continent through the Pacific Ocean. I didn't establish any deep ties with the Nipponese Underworld, but I did learn some things about it. For example, there are no Yin Yang Mezzanines in the mortal realm in Nippon. Instead, all of its entrances to the underworld are in its Shinto shrines. Do you know of shimenawa? According to Nipponese legends, stepping over a shimenawa entails crossing into another world. In reality, that's not just a myth. The Nipponese Underworld has a total of nine Abyssal Prefects, but only Izanami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto are advanced Abyssal Prefects ruling over the nine regions. They are assisted by around 30 Infernal Judges, who keep records of almost all of the shimenawa, including who they are and when they crossed over. Only through those places can one enter the Nipponese Underworld. In other words, the entrances to the Nipponese Underworld are very narrow, which make them very inconvenient for armies to pass through. This indicates that Izanami has already abandoned all thoughts of expanding her territory. However, if you want to advance your army into the Nipponese Underworld, then the only way would be by crossing over the shimenawa.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes narrowed slightly as he asked, \"What do you mean when you say they keep records of 'almost' all of the shimenawa?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xu Fu replied, \"I once heard a rumor. There is a set number of shimenawa in Nippon, but there are some that are unmonitored.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes narrowed slightly upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They're either situated near dilapidated and abandoned shrines, or in extremely secluded areas. There's no one maintaining those shimenawa, but with the passage of time, some of them seem to be barely hanging on by a thread, but they refuse to snap. Why do you think that is?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I have no time to play games,\" Qin Ye said in an indifferent voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xu Fu smiled as he continued, \"It's because of the Shinto religion. All underworlds exist due to legends in the mortal realm. That's how things like grand scripts of death come into existence. The legends and religions of the mortal realm can have an extremely significant impact on an underworld, and the existence of the Shinto religion makes it so that everything in Nippon truly has a spirit. Thus, it's not an uncommon sight for things like ancient trees or rocks in secluded places to develop spirits over time. The shimenawa that they draw are more so for marking out their own territory rather than connecting the underworld with the mortal realm, and if I recall correctly, the most renowned of those territories belong to three ghostly immortals. The first one is Aokigahara of the Fuji River in Yamanashi prefecture. Upon reaching the deepest point of Aokigahara, you'll encounter two massive trees that have centuries of history, and between them is a shimenawa formed entirely by interwoven black and white hair. The second place is Sandanbeki Rock Cliff of Wakayama prefecture. The shimenawa there is situated out at sea between two stone pillars, and it's formed by the remains of seabirds, with all types of bird's nests resting on it. The third one is the waterfall of Tojinbo in Fukui prefecture. The shimenawa rope there is situated on the seabed instead of on the surface of the sea. There are two giant stone pillars on the seabed there, between which is a shimenawa formed by seaweed, all types of shellfish, and the remains of fish. Foreigners wouldn't be able to draw the connection at all, but the Nipponese would definitely be able to identify it as a shimenawa.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He made a grabbing motion with one hand, and a horsetail whisk flew into his grasp as he continued, \"If you would like to increase the scale at which your army advances into the Nipponese Underworld, then you'll have to come into contact with these three demonic ghostly immortals.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who are they?\" Arthis asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I don't know,\" Xu Fu replied. \"I don't have much interest in beings below the Yama-King level. However, they are the only pathways between Nippon and its underworld that aren't monitored by Amano-Iwato. There are some other shimenawa as well that belong to creatures such as Bake-danuki, but those are too small to be useful to you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a very important piece of information, and Qin Ye committed it to his memory before asking, \"Is there anything else?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There are many other pieces of information I can provide. How about you give me a month to recollect everything, then write it all down for you?\" Xu Fu suggested. \"If you want to know more information as quickly as possible, there's someone I can recommend to you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who is that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Liu Yu, of course,\" Xu Fu replied with a smile. \"Liu Yu was the first Emissary of Hell of note to contact Izanami, so she was naturally eager to reciprocate, and she sent someone by the name of Thẩm Điền Tử to Liu Yu.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thẩm Điền Tử?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's brows furrowed slightly upon hearing this.

As such, there's naturally no need for you to be wary of a mere Anitya Hellguard. However, Thẩm Điền Tử was sent as a representative of Izanami, and during the first two years, all communication between Fantasy City and Izanami was facilitated through Thẩm Điền Tử. In the beginning, we only traded some general items such as specialty local products, but as time passed, Thẩm Điền Tử began to ask for cultivation arts, arts, and artifacts. After that, he was replaced by Otakemaru, who began to engage in trade of military weapons with me. Don't forget that Liu Yu is outside of the Array of the Nine Gods.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye stood up as he nodded in response. \"Alright, I understand.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no further exchange of words, and Qin Ye and Arthis promptly departed. After returning to the six paths of reincarnation, Arthis turned to Qin Ye before asking, \"What are you going to do?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on Qin Ye's face as he departed as a gust of Yin wind. \"I'm going to make an example out of him, of course!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Liu Yu lifted the curtain of the carriage that he was sitting in before looking outside with an uneasy expression, and only after several minutes had passed did he allow the curtain to fall again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were less than 10 kilometers away from Everburn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had already been a very long time since he had been here, and he was astonished by just how drastically the Cathayan Underworld had transformed over the past two decades.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of massive carriages drawn by Yin beasts were traveling along the main road. Most of them were cargo carriages, and there were quite a few passenger carriages as well, but not many of them were privately owned. After all, keeping and maintaining a Yin beast was quite expensive.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were countless orchards and farms on either side of the road. With the dissemination of the new energy resource, the Cathayan Underworld was able to replicate the large-scale farming machinery of the mortal realm. This type of model actually wasn't suitable in Cathay due to its massive population, but that wasn't an issue in the Cathayan Underworld. Due to the comparatively smaller population, it was actually easier to implement farming on a large scale.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was often the case that stretches of factories would be interspersed between the farmlands. Those were processing plants for different types of food such as eggs and dairy, meat and poultry, and even tea and other beverages. All of these industries were coexisting alongside the large-scale farms in a symbiotic relationship, presenting a prosperous sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of cargo carriages were parked on the side of the road before traveling to all parts of the nation after they were filled with different types of food products. Liu Yu closed his eyes with a pained expression as he lowered the curtain.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He naturally wasn't going to take a public transport carriage. Instead, he was sitting in a luxurious rental beast-drawn carriage. The interior of the carriage was as stable as if they were in a stationary room, and there were all types of furniture, snacks, and beverages inside the carriage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thẩm Điền Tử, Vương Trấn Ác, and Chu Linh Thạch were also in the carriage, but none of them were saying anything. Only after a long while did Chu Linh Thạch heave a forlorn sigh. \"It still feels like a dream...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, the rapid development that the Cathayan Underworld had experienced during the past 20 years was completely surreal!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Liu Yu took a sip of tea before gently setting his teacup down onto the table. \"Have you noticed that not a single person has come to greet us since we entered the Cathayan Underworld? We were only granted travel permits by the relevant departments. What do you think that implies?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one dared to reply.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a clear indication that Hell was already completely disappointed in the Hanyang Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had never been so fearful toward what was waiting for them, and this fear was being exacerbated further and further the closer they drew to Everburn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long while, Liu Yu heaved a resigned sigh. \"We can only hope Yanluo Qin will forgive us in light of what we've prepared...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't even convinced by his own words, but in the face of this colossal powerhouse, he no longer had any intention of resisting.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, a massive plaque bearing the word \"Everburn\" appeared in the distance, and it was surrounded by hovering specks of white netherfire, making it look as if it were alive.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beneath the plaque was a security checkpoint constructed in the style of the Han Dynasty, and beyond the checkpoint was the vast and majestic city that was Everburn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The city was a perfect combination of antiquated and modern elements, and Liu Yu slowly closed his eyes as he instructed, \"Take us to the Zhou Manor at 1204 Yellow Springs Road. \"</span></p>"

They were given fantastic benefits, but they had nothing to do! The entire nation was rapidly becoming more powerful, and the confidence that the population had in the nation was growing by the day, but they had nothing to do with that!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, all that was about to change!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A young scientist adjusted his own glasses before immediately rushing over.

There were even some who went as far as to detach their own heads and toss them forward so that they could hang around the hole like orbiting stars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Get your heads back as well!\" Zu Chongzhi was almost roaring with fury at this point.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Can these people not have some restraint?!

A burst of powerful Yin energy was released, following which a skull with a head of red hair appeared above the hole.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone fell silent in this instant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was what they had been dreaming of for years, and even Zu Chongzhi was completely speechless in this moment. Everyone here knew the Omeyocan plan back to front, so it was immediately apparent to them that this was the required medium for them to construct their super telescope!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, they could sense that this skull was even more powerful than that of the average Yama-King!

He heaved a faint sigh, yet right as he was about to speak, Qin Ye beat him to it. \"Please be quiet, everyone!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His Yama-King level Yin energy swept over the entire platform, and everyone immediately fell silent. Qin Ye smiled as he swept his gaze across everyone present, then asked, \"What's the rush?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What's the rush?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone faltered slightly upon hearing this before the fervent looks in their eyes became even more pronounced.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Does that mean... there's more?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't try to build any suspense, and he made a grabbing motion right in front of everyone's eager eyes, upon which another black ball appeared in his grasp. On this occasion, as soon as the black ball appeared, the netherfire in the eyes of all of the scientists present erupted violently, and they frantically retreated to several dozen meters away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their reaction was purely instinctive, one that was natural in the face of any apex predator.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They could sense that the black ball posed a lethal threat to them, one that was near inevitable, much like the power of laws!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zu Chongzhi was also in the same situation. His chest was heaving violently, and his back was pressed tightly against a table as he asked, \"Your Excellency, could it be...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's right, it's a being above the Yama-King level,\" Qin Ye replied with a smile. \"And it's also going to be our spacecraft.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, a streak of light erupted straight into the dark heavens up above. Immediately thereafter, a burst of golden Yin energy rose up into the sky like a reverse waterfall, and layers upon layers of Yin clouds instantly gathered, creating a breathtaking sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A loud buzzing sound rang out, following which a massive butterfly that was over 100 kilometers in size descended from the Yin clouds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire platform instantly fell deathly silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In comparison with this gargantuan object, the scientists down below were like specks of dust. This was also the present that had lied beyond the final gate in the Heavenly Dao's palace of ice, the complete physical body of the inner demon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though this wasn't the first time that Qin Ye had seen this body, he still couldn't help but be awestruck in its presence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From the moment that he first laid eyes on it, a concept of the spacecraft had already emerged in his heart. Nothing was more suitable for this purpose. The body of a being above the Yama-King level was virtually indestructible, and if it were to be used as a spacecraft, it would undoubtedly be the ruler of the cosmos!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency, is this...

He swung around to face Zu Chongzhi as he urged, \"Please give the order now, President! I'm willing to make a pledge right here, right now, that I'll produce an outcome within the next five years with the three research and development groups!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Not so fast!\" An elderly Yin spirit with a head of white hair suddenly stepped forward with around a dozen scientists behind him. \"What makes you think you have the right to take on this project? Do you think I'm so old that I'm already senile? How many credentials do you have compared with mine? I think my second group is most qualified to take on this project!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to finish, another elderly man stepped forward. \"From the Chang'e project to the Yutu project, I've been the designer of six of the total of 14 satellites! I think we would all agree that the most skilled and qualified personnel should be assigned to this project, and that would undoubtedly be me and my group!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That must be why both Chang'e-2 and Yutu-3 failed!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Even so, I still created four successful satellites!

It was up to the scientists to decide who would take on which projects, he had more important things to do.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had to begin planting footholds in Amano-Iwato in preparation for the future invasion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was also going to be a lengthy process. Among Hell's Yama-Kings, both Arthis and the Harken were extremely arrogant. If he were to send them to the Nipponese Underworld for negotiations, they would most likely instigate a war right away!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun was also unsuitable for the task. He was quite calm, but he wasn't a brilliant politician. As for Abyssal Prefects and Infernal Judges, they would simply fail to properly represent the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the task had to fall upon his shoulders.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"However, before that, I have some things to do,\" he murmured to himself before vanishing as a gust of Yin wind, and shortly thereafter, he had already arrived at the North Yin Pavilion in Everburn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He sat down at his own desk before writing out two imperial edicts, then knocked onto his desk, following which Secretary Jiang quickly made his way into the office.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Take this to the panel of advisors,\" Qin Ye said as he handed Secretary Jiang one of the imperial edicts, then continued, \"This one goes to the Hanyang Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Secretary Jiang picked up the imperial edicts before taking a look, and the netherfire in his eyes immediately flickered slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first imperial edict instructed the panel of advisors to devise as detailed a wartime strategy as possible within a season with the Nipponese Underworld as the hypothetical enemy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second imperial edict was a summons to the ruler of Hanyang, Liu Yu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both of these imperial edicts were teeming with killing intent, and Secretary Jiang carefully stowed them up his sleeve.

They were like bright celestial bodies in a storm of lightning.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Bursts of Yin energy converged toward the blade to ignite the dazzling stars, and there were around 17 stars in total on the entire sword. However, each one of them was extremely slow to light up, and right as the fifth star was ignited, the surrounding Yin energy abruptly shuddered before completely fading.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What a pity,\" Qin Ye sighed as he turned around.

It had only just been completed, yet only in theory was it able to contain a second-generation forbidden art. Unfortunately, during this first experiment, it was only able to gather Yin energy in five of its nodes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unless all 17 nodes could light up at once, the second-generation forbidden art couldn't be completed. Furthermore, the subsequent molds would potentially have to undergo massive changes in order to light up all 17 nodes, so at the very most, only a quarter of the project was complete.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one was surprised by this, and Lu Ban was completely unfazed.

This projection is thanks, in large part, to the cooperation of Ghost King Zhao, whose understanding of advanced Yin runes is near unrivaled in this world. However, subsequent required injection of funds is going to be a big problem...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Just do what you need to do,\" Qin Ye instructed without any hesitation. \"As long as the costs are necessary, I'll ensure that they're met.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, Wang Chenghao quickly made his way over to them. \"Your Excellency, the panel of advisors have submitted their plan of action against the Nipponese Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a deep breath upon hearing this, then asked, \"Where are they right now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They've already arrived at the Yin Mountains,\" Wang Chenghao replied as the two of them quickly departed. \"The main decision-makers behind the plan were Director Qin Changxin and the top academicians of the panel of advisors. From this day forth, the panel of advisors will be split up into two groups, one of which will go to the Yin Mountains Research Institute, while the other will go to the Sword Coral Research Institute, and that'll allow them to constantly monitor the progress of the two projects.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All wartime strategies had to be decided based on real-world circumstances, and second-generation forbidden arts and the means by which to launch the forbidden arts were imperative for the plan to succeed. Thus, these two pieces of technology formed the core of this strategy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response, then quickly passed through a long corridor with excitement in his heart before arriving in front of a large door.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The door was opened, and Qin Ye stepped into the room beyond before giving everyone inside a casual nod. \"Take a seat, everyone.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the door was a spacious conference hall, within which around a dozen underworld emissaries had already gathered. After taking a seat, Qin Ye wasted no time in getting to the main topic at hand. \"Let's begin. Who's going to be presenting the plan to me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin rose to his feet.

At the moment, what we know is that the core of the Nipponese Underworld is split up into three levels, the Dream Caverns, the Blood Maggot Abyss, and the Inner Heavens. According to what I've seen and heard in the past, the entirety of the Nipponese Underworld is situated underground, and its entrance resembles a volcano. Yin spirits are taken to the volcanic crater by underworld emissaries before jumping in, and the Dream Caverns refer to the stretch from the volcanic crater to underground. The Blood Maggot Abyss is where Izanami's entire body was consumed by maggots, while the Inner Heavens are a highland constructed beneath the ground to replicate Takamagahara. Its highest point is Izanami's resting quarters, Amano-Iwato.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone present, including Qin Ye, was listening intently in silence. Meanwhile, Qin Changxin's voice continued to echo throughout the conference hall. \"According to Liu Yu's records, the Nipponese Underworld hasn't explored Limbo. As we all know, there are Prefect-level monarch beasts residing in Limbo, so it would be too dangerous for third-rate underworlds to explore. In contrast, our Cathayan Underworld is able to access the mortal realm through Yin Yang Mezzanines that pass directly through Limbo. The Nipponese Underworld does not have the power to protect those passageways, so they employed a different method.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He set his chair aside before taking a few steps backward, then began to draw a design in the air with his hand. Soon, the image of a massive mirror that was completely formed by Yin energy took shape in mid-air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a stone mirror, with a mirror surface at the center surrounded by a stone frame. The material of the frame had been carved into the form of Izanami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto, and the carvings were holding the mirror with their hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is an inter-realm mirror,\" Qin Changxin introduced in a serious voice. \"There are over 1,000 of these mirrors in the Nipponese Underworld, and they can connect the underworld to the mortal realm, so this is how their underworld emissaries traverse between the two realms. The final destinations that these mirrors lead to are the areas beyond the shimenawa ropes of the major Shinto shrines.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye raised an eyebrow upon hearing this. \"Are you saying that there are only around 1,000 openings through which the Nipponese Underworld can deploy its troops?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's correct.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How big are these mirrors?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They're around 20 meters wide and 15 meters tall.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. This meant that at the very most, the mirrors could only allow rows of 20 Yin soldiers to pass through, which would equate to a maximum of 20,000 troops deployed at a time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of Hell's army enhanced by the Wumu military formation, an army of 20,000 would be nothing more than cannon fodder!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, one of the other decision-making academicians interjected, \"Your Excellency, this is not an arrangement that the Nipponese Underworld chose voluntarily. Do you still recall the time when the seven underworld joined forces to attack our Cathayan Underworld?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response, and the academician continued, \"Back then, the army of the Russian Underworld was stationed at the Nipponese Underworld, which was also involved in the war. However, as we all know, they never set foot into our Cathayan Underworld in the end. Seeing as they failed, they had to accept a punishment, and that punishment was for the Nipponese Underworld to rid itself of all avenues through which it could mobilize troops on a large scale. Even now, the Nipponese Underworld still doesn't dare to go against this order that's been enforced upon them. On top of that, this is not just a matter of 20,000 troops. While it's true that they can only deploy 20,000 troops at a time, and that's nowhere near enough to combat our army, the important thing to realize is that those 20,000 troops will be distributed throughout all of the Nipponese Underworld. In other words, if we focus our attack on a single place, we won't even be facing 20,000 troops.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I see...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin continued, \"This is plan A, which involves attacking from the mortal realm.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is there something wrong with that?\" Qin Ye asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin didn't give a direct reply. Instead, he said, \"Following this plan would create a problem. The Nipponese Underworld is very much aware of its limitations, so it intentionally made its inter-realm mirrors quite small, thereby making their nation more difficult to invade and easier to defend. Thus, the same restrictions apply to us in that we can also deploy 20,000 troops into their borders at a time.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was unknown whether the Amatsukami would participate in the war, but there was a very high likelihood that they would. In any case, the main opposition that they would have to face would still be from the Kunitsukami. The Nipponese Underworld could deploy 20,000 troops at a time, but this was referring to deployment from the underworld to the mortal realm, while the same limitation applied to the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the 20,000 troops of Hell's army would have to face the four million Kunitsukami, and no matter how weak those Kunitsukami were, victory was still all but assured for them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye stroked his own chin in a contemplative silence for a long while before asking, \"What's plan B?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Plan B involves attacking from the underworld. We enter Hokkaido from the Strait of Tsushima, locking down the coastline of Hokkaido while the Hanyang Underworld also deploys its troops to intercept the Nipponese Underworld's army from the other side, thereby forcing them into a showdown with us in Kansai or Chugoku. Once that happens, we'll be able to wipe them out in one fell swoop with a forbidden art!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What are the limitations of that plan?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The issue here is that the Nipponese Underworld has always been extremely cautious when it comes to the Strait of Tsushima. They're constantly monitoring the area, so we wouldn't be able to mobilize our army without their detection. As soon as they discover our intention to attack Hokkaido, they'll be able to choose to engage us in naval warfare in the Sea of Nippon. What makes things even more troublesome is the Nipponese Underworld's national protective array, Divine Wind.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's brows furrowed slightly upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just the name of this array alone spelled trouble.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Many years ago, the Mongolian Empire almost conquered Nippon, but their entire army was forced back into retreat by none other than a gust of wind. All of the Nipponese people thanked the heavens for this miracle, referring to it as the Divine Wind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taking back Yue Fei from the Nipponese Underworld was one thing, but there was also the other objective, which was for the Cathayan Underworld to flex its muscles to the entire world. Deploying Yama-Kings alone wouldn't be enough. All of the other three pillars had access to top-tier military formations, which allowed them to stall a Yama-King for a short time with just tens of thousands of Yin soldiers. Thus, Yama-Kings on their own wouldn't be able to produce a sufficiently intimidatory effect.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What they had to display was a brand new way of war that was unique to the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The intention was to shock the entire world with a moment similar to when the atomic bombs were dropped in the second world war.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only then would they be able to ensure that the Array of the Nine Gods could be safely withdrawn without the three pillars constantly raring to make a move against the Cathayan Underworld. They would constantly remember that plotting against the Cathayan Underworld could lead to devastating consequences.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With the Divine Wind Array at their disposal, the Nipponese Underworld would definitely choose the Nipponese Sea as their battleground. Even if they didn't react right away, they should at least be able to intercept the Cathayan Underworld's army near Hokkaido, and that would not be ideal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they couldn't even take down a third-rate underworld like the Nipponese Underworld with speed and ease, then that would be like a slap to the face for the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Looks like neither plan A nor plan B are viable. Is there a plan C?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin replied, \"No, but we do have a combination plan. Firstly, we deploy troops from the Hanyang Underworld to pressure the Nipponese Underworld from the Shikoku region, making it appear as if we're going to launch a direct attack there...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to finish, Qin Ye's eyes lit up as he said, \"So you're saying we distract them in the underworld while taking down the three unmonitored shimenawa ropes in the mortal realm before using those to enter Hokkaido. After that, we advance our army from both sides to force the enemy to the center, is that correct?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Changxin had a chance to reply, Qin Ye continued, \"In doing so, we'll definitely be able to corner the Nipponese Underworld's army into a final showdown, but during the process, they'll vacate a lot of territory, which we'll have to conquer. However, if we do that, our forces will be weakened as we don't have that many troops to spare.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin nodded in response. \"That's right, which is why we still need to do one more thing, which is to find puppets for our Cathayan Underworld!\"</span></p>"

However, if he were to give Liu Yu no hope at all, then there was a very good chance that Liu Yu would simply refuse to say anything or provide false information. If that were to happen, he wouldn't be able to derive any benefit out of this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, he wanted Liu Yu to hand over the information himself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a gentle wave of his hand, the box flew into Qin Ye's grasp, following which he returned to his seat as a gust of Yin wind, and only after a long while did he speak again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Liu Yu.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm here.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"In the wake of the fall of Fengdu, you staged a coup with the forces of Hanyang, and that is a crime of treason. You established your own territory, refusing to return to the Cathayan Underworld, that is a crime of insubordination. You collaborated with external forces to conspire against your own nation, and that is a crime of disloyalty. For those three crimes, you will be sentenced to the ultimate punishment in the six paths of reincarnation.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that instant, Liu Yu's breathing completely stopped, and he felt as if the world were falling apart around him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His vision went completely dark, and he was clawing at the carpet with such force that it was being torn by his fingers. He opened his mouth several times to say something, but was unable to say anything in the end.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No...

Had I been in your position, I wouldn't have been so kind.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye smiled in response and offered no reply. At this point, the 12 envoys were virtually negligible to the current Hell, so sentencing Liu Yu didn't affect him much on an emotional level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Get Zhou Gongjin to come and see me,\" he said in an indifferent voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as the order was issued, a voice declared from outside, \"Zhou Gongjin, Yanluo Qin will see you now!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the sound of a long horn rang out, and the gates were opened one after another. Soon, Zhou Yu made his way into the palace, clad in a full suit of armor, then cupped his fist in a salute. \"Zhou Gongjin pays his respects to Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was seated casually on his throne, gently drumming the armrest with his fingers as he said with a smile, \"Long time no see, Commander Zhou. Have you been well?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The netherfire in Zhou Yu's eyes flickered slightly as he hurriedly replied, \"I have been well, thank you for asking, Your Excellency.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No need for formalities,\" Qin Ye said. \"I saw the valiant efforts of the 12 envoys during the Battle of Zhuolu.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We were only doing what was to be expected of us.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These replies were a little rigid, and Qin Ye didn't like that. He put on a nonchalant display as he remarked, \"It looks like the 12 envoys are still as powerful as ever.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It seemed like nothing more than an errant remark, but it immediately set Zhou Yu's mind racing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What's that supposed to mean? Does he think we're too powerful and is beginning to grow wary of us?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He carefully contemplated his words before replying, \"In order to make up for our past mistakes, we haven't dared to slack off in our training for even a single day so that we would constantly be ready to serve Hell when required.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The fear and caution in Zhou Yu's words were very apparent, and Qin Ye couldn't help but think back to the time when the 12 envoys had stormed Everburn, which was only a plot of barren land. He was willing to bet that they had never thought the day would come where they would have to Hell like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How is the training of the naval forces coming along?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The netherfire in Zhou Yu's eyes flickered once again upon hearing this, and he seemed to have realized something as he replied, \"I've been constantly training our naval forces in preparation for the day that they'll be deployed.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"I have a mission, and after much thought, I realized that you're the only one capable of undertaking it. In the wake of Liu Yu's punishment, Hanyang will be vacant. However, the Hanyang Underworld is situated at a very important location, monitoring both the Strait of Tsushima and the Russian Underworld, so it cannot be without a leader. Will you be able to take over?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes, Yanluo Qin! I would be honored!\" Zhou Yu immediately replied as he cupped his fist in an elated salute.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye cautioned with a meaningful expression, \"Don't forget that these are naval forces of the sea, which are different from the naval forces of the Red Cliffs.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I've never trained sea-dwelling naval forces, but I'm willing to give it a try!\" Zhou Yu certainly wasn't going to pass up this opportunity!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Alright, you can go now,\" Qin Ye said with a dismissive wave of his hand. \"You'll receive an official assignment notice within a week. As for what you're going to do and how you're expected to develop Hanyang, Governor Qin Hui will be the one to tell you all that.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\" Zhou Yu took a deep breath before departing from the hall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside the hall, Qin Ye exchanged a glance with Yu Qian and Yang Jiye. At this point, all of the preparations were underway, and all that was left was for the panel of advisors to go through the information provided by Liu Yu and devise a plan to invade the Nipponese Underworld. The gears of war had already been set into motion...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye rose to his feet as he cupped his fist in a salute. \"I'll be taking my leave now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Yu Qian and Yang Jiye had a chance to speak, he continued, \"Once the panel of advisors decides on a plan, I'll be sure to notify the two of you right away via messenger birds. All you have to do is keep a close eye on the Hindustani Underworld and the Strait of Tsushima. Make sure not even a single fly gets past you!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">………………………………………………..</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time passed by very quickly, and a quarter flashed past in the blink of an eye. Everything was peaceful and prosperous in the Cathayan Underworld, and the nation was developing rapidly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the surface, there didn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary happening, but there were certain things that were unfolding in a slow and subtle manner away from the public eye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For example, the term \"Nipponese Underworld\" was frequently making headlines during the past quarter.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the past few years, the Cathayan Underworld hadn't refrained from participating in international conferences. The nation had only just re-established its place in the world, and it was naturally wise to bolster that position.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That wasn't to say that they attended every conference that they could, but the Cathayan Underworld was never absent from the important conferences. During this time, the Cathayan Underworld naturally interacted with all of the other major underworlds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The most frequent subject of international news in relation to the Cathayan Underworld was Izanami of the Nipponese Underworld. However, all of these pieces of news were negative with no exceptions. For example, there were news stories about how Izanami was opposed to the Cathayan Underworld's policies, how she was a spokesperson for the three pillars, encouraging the Russian Underworld to form an Eastern Asian co-prosperity sphere, only to be rejected.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of these pieces of news were spread through the media as subtle propaganda, and within the short span of just a month, public opinion of the Nipponese Underworld had begun to plummet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, this was only the beginning.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A reason had to be manufactured to instigate this war. Only then could they contain controversy and prevent an eruption of domestic anti-war sentiments. Thus, the first thing that the Cathayan Underworld had to do was to villainize the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thankfully, the two nations had a less than amicable relationship to begin with, and that was why it had been so easy to stir up public outrage toward the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were also other preparatory measures being taken, such as Minister of Defense Qin Changxin's recent announcement that two fleets consisting of a total of four naval divisions were going to be established in the next three years, or the policy that the government had implemented at the end of March to open up all coastal ports and support the shipbuilding industry.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanks to the Array of the Nine Gods, the Cathayan Underworld didn't have to hide its intentions. No one could leak any information to the outside world, but those in the Cathayan Underworld who knew what to look for could already see the writing on the wall. As a result, the number of Yin spirits conscripted into the military swelled to an all-time high, and around 20% of all enrolment applications in the nation were submitted to military academies.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This machine of war that was powerful enough to strike fear into the entire world was already being silently mobilized, and once it emerged from the Array of the Nine Gods, it would lay waste to its unfortunate target.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meanwhile, Qin Ye's attention was primarily dedicated to the research into space exploration technology and second-generation forbidden arts. Without those two things, there was no way he was going to war, even if the entire nation fully supported a war effort.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During this process, he also discovered some new uses for the origin rune of emotions and desires. At the moment, he could control it to split it up into countless butterflies, and he could control these butterflies at will anywhere within the Cathayan Underworld, but he couldn't sense them when they were in the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Each butterfly was capable of stirring up or calming a Yin spirit's emotions, so there was one accompanying every single researcher in the Sword Coral Research Institute and the Yin Mountains Research Institute.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This allowed all of the scientists to be absolutely calm or extremely fervent depending on the requirements of the situation. Thus, Qin Ye was able to manipulate their emotions like machines, and the efficiency of the two research institutes was raised by about 20% as a result.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Out of the two research institutes, the Yin Mountains Research Institute was by far the more renowned one. After all, it was the birthplace of the electricity-like energy string. However, the Sword Coral Research Institute was certainly nothing to be scoffed at, and it was constantly vying to outdo its more renowned counterpart, so there was a relationship of healthy competition between the two.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, in the Yin Mountains Research Institute, Qin Ye and Lu Ban were peering through a panel of glass with serious expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the newly developed impact-resistant glass, and it would take five minutes even for an Abyssal Prefect to shatter it.

Instead of a linear system, theirs is more like a triangular system with Izanami at the top of the triangle. There are three powers vying with one another, and not all of them are in support of Izanami's reign. In fact, there are even some among them with pro-Cathayan sentiments.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye raised his head and took a meaningful look at Qin Changxin upon hearing this, but didn't say anything. With a gentle wave of his hand, the documents on the table flew over to him, and he began to carefully inspect them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but remained silent in the end and sat back down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His eagerness had gotten the better of him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He knew what mistake he had made. He had been yearning for this for several centuries, and due to his excessive eagerness, he had missed some things.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For example, Izanami wasn't the only Abyssal Prefect in the Nipponese Underworld. She was the only one who could be considered to be half a step away from the Yama-King level, but in terms of Abyssal Prefects, there were actually nine in total in the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was Yamata no Orochi of Kyushu, Susa Boy of Chugoku, Susanoo-no-Mikoto of Kansai, Izanami of Chubu, Hato of Kanto, Emperor Sutoku of Tohoku, and Tamamo-no-Mae of Hokkaido.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Each Abyssal Prefect was overseeing a region. Izanami knew that she wasn't powerful enough to force all of the Abyssal Prefects to submit to her, so she very wisely chose to adopt an authoritarian system. The number of troops in each region wouldn't exceed 300,000, and the rest were all gathered in Kanto or Chubu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This information should've been disclosed to Qin Ye from the get-go, but in his haste to proceed, Qin Changxin had neglected to do so. It was as if he wanted to convince Qin Ye that attacking the Nipponese Underworld was a trivial matter that he didn't need to personally attend to, and that all he had to do was give his approval.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Qin Ye were a mediocre ruler, he would've most likely allowed Qin Changxin to do as he pleased. However, as a conscientious ruler who ruled with an iron fist, the more information that Qin Changxin revealed, the more he was struck by the feeling that things were creeping out of his control. This was why Qin Ye had chosen to silence Qin Changxin for now, and it was also a silent reprimand, warning him not to get ahead of himself in these crucial moments.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A wry smile appeared on Qin Changxin's face as he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I thought I'd be able to face all of this calmly, but we've only just begun the planning process and I've already completely lost control over my own emotions. How pitiful...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time slowly passed by, and the only sound that could be heard in the hall was the rustling of pages. The displeasure in Qin Ye's heart had already faded, and he was completely absorbed by the information that he was reading.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just as Qin Changxin had said, aside from demons and deities of the Nipponese Underworld, there were two more prominent powers, the first of which was the warring states.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Almost every Nipponese warring state had a Daimyo assigned by Izanami, and the heart of each area was the tenshu pavilion of the Daimyo, while the caves of the nine ghostly monarchs were situated at the center of each region.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nipponese Underworld had a total of 54 tenshu pavilions, which was identical to the number of warring states during the Nipponese Sengoku period.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The forces of the warring states weren't included in the four million Kunitsukami, and the number of troops under each Daimyo was forbidden from crossing 10,000. Even so, that would amount to a total of 540,000 additional Yin soldiers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second of those aforementioned forces were the consortiums.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In contrast with the consortiums of the mortal realm, the consortiums of the underworld had the right to assemble private armies!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">According to Liu Yu's records, the dealings that took place between the Hanyang Underworld and the Nipponese Underworld had always been facilitated by the Hongan-ji Consortium. This was a consortium with ties to the government, and it was the self-proclaimed second consortium of the Nipponese Underworld. However, Liu Yu didn't know the names of the other consortiums.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's brows furrowed slightly as he asked, \"What is Hongan-ji?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin had been carefully observing Qin Ye this entire time, waiting for an opportunity to redeem himself, and he immediately explained, \"Your Excellency, the Hongan-ji is the head temple of Nippon's Jōdo Shinshū religion. Saint Shinran founded the Jōdo Shinshū religion in 1272 during the Kamakura period. In 1465, the head temple was burned down. In 1483, the eighth Monshu, Rennyo, constructed a new head temple in the Yamashina Ward of Kyoto. In 1535, the temple was burned down again by Daimyo Rokkaku Yoshikata and the Tendai Sect. In 1542, the 10th Monshu, Shōnyo, constructed the head temple once again in Ishiyama of Settsu Province. In 1580, the temple was burned down by me, and that was how I received my title as enemy of the Buddha.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice was moderate in volume, just loud enough for everyone to listen to, but not loud enough to disrupt one's thoughts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye gave a slight nod in response, and Qin Changxin continued, \"Prior to the Sengoku period in Nippon, the temples were undoubtedly one of the wealthiest powers. The Jōdo Shinshū religion's heritage has already stretched for over 600 years, and during that time, it's most definitely built up a strong foundation. There is an eternal rule in the underworld, which is first come, first serve. Even the six major consortiums, which were incredibly powerful entities in Nippon in the mortal realm during the 1980s, once they enter the underworld, they'll have to face the established, existing consortiums, and it'll be extremely difficult for them to outdo such stern competition. The modern shareholding system makes it so that they're unable to be buried with large amounts of wealth after they die, unlike the eight major clans of the Cathayan Underworld. The Hongan-ji Consortium would definitely take measures to prevent the likes of Liu Yu from coming into contact with other consortiums, so it's no surprise that he doesn't know the names of any of the other consortiums.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin was a seasoned politician, and he immediately caught on to where he had gone wrong before quickly making adjustments, but instead of being encouraged by this information, Qin Ye's brows were tightly furrowed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Hongan-ji Consortium was the self-proclaimed number two consortium of the Nipponese Underworld, so the number one consortium was undoubtedly the Sacred Treasure Consortium, one of the world's top 10 consortiums. However, he didn't want to collaborate with the Sacred Treasure Consortium.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For an entity as powerful as the Sacred Treasure Consortium, it didn't matter to them whether the Nipponese Underworld fell or not. If he were to collaborate with them, a situation could potentially arise where they would compete with the Cathayan Underworld for the initiative, and that was not something he wanted to see.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He shifted his gaze toward the Kanto and Chubu regions. Only with a map and this information as reference did he slowly begin to discover some issues that he had previously completely failed to notice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several minutes later, he tapped the table as he raised his head and said, \"I can see that everyone has predicted that the armies of the three pillars will be passing through the Strait of Tsushima, and the suggestion is that we intercept them at the Ryukyu Islands. I have no objections to that, but can we go into further detail here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Ryukyu Islands connected Formosa and the Nipponese Underworld. If they could claim those islands, then they would be able to cut off a major avenue through which reinforcements could be provided to the Nipponese Underworld. The only alternative would be to go through the Russian Underworld, but that was completely implausible. Unless the nameless god of death had turned into an idiot overnight, there was no way that he would allow millions of foreign Yin soldiers to pass through his nation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course.\" The academician was rather perplexed by the lack of response from Qin Changxin, but he immediately took over nonetheless. \"Similar to the situation in the mortal realm, there are some territorial disputes taking place in the Ryukyu Islands in the underworld as well. However, they wouldn't dare to say anything if we took over the islands by force. At the very most, all they would be able to do would be to complain to the Coalition of Underworlds, but if our Cathayan Underworld is willing to make a compromise of even a single decimal point on the new energy resource, I'm sure no other underworld would support the Nipponese Underworld. Once we take over the Ryukyu Islands, we'll be able to turn it into a stronghold on the front lines during the next few years to contend with the threat from the three pillars. The Kraken will have to be present in order to oppose the Argosian Underworld's Golden Fleet and the Naga Fleet, and the Ryukyu Islands will serve as the perfect supply station.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"Alright, so if we manage to stop the three pillars' forces at the Ryukyu Islands, we must ensure that on the other end, we can force all of the Nipponese Underworld's troops into one place as quickly as possible. Due to the limitations of the inter-realm mirrors, we won't be able to deploy a large number of troops at once. Thus, in order to achieve this objective, we must accumulate troops in Hokkaido before deploying them in a single wave. However, the map clearly states that the three most powerful arrays in Nippon in the mortal realm are all situated in the Kanto and Chubu regions. Even once our troops descend into the Nipponese Underworld, they'll arrive in Kanto and Chubu, which are both a long way away from Hokkaido.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He looked up at all of the underworld emissaries present with a grim expression as he continued, \"Hence, we need an insider, a puppet that will work with us from within the Nipponese Underworld. We can grant a certain corporation a monopoly in the Nipponese Underworld in the future, and we can even elevate their leader to become an Abyssal Prefect. However, if we don't have such a puppet, our army will be unable to go all the way from Chubu to Hokkaido. It's not like we're unable to force all of the Nipponese Underworld's Yin soldiers to Chubu if we don't conquer Hokkaido, but it'll take far longer to achieve that objective. I'm sure everyone is aware of our nation's true power at the moment, and it's certainly not wise for us to expend our forces in the Nipponese Underworld. The whole point of this war is for us to set an example to the rest of the world by crushing the Nipponese Underworld with our second-generation forbidden arts.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, a problem arose: who was going to approach the suitable clan, corporation, or perhaps even daimyo in the Nipponese Underworld?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the downside of an isolated nation. The only viable candidate was Qin Changxin, but as an Abyssal Prefect, there was a very good chance that he would be discovered. Sending darkfeathers would also be inappropriate. This was an extremely important matter, and if the darkfeathers were to be captured by emissaries of the Nipponese Underworld, it would only take a simple soul search to expose the entire plan.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one among the Harken, Zhao Yun, or Arthis had any connections in the Nipponese Underworld, so there was no one that could take on this role!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long silence, Qin Ye finally decided, \"I'll make a trip to the Nipponese Underworld myself.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Where do you plan to strike from, Your Excellency?\" Qin Changxin asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm going after the three great yokai of the mortal realm,\" Qin Ye replied. \"If I can't establish a connection through them, I'll have them killed and conjure up false evidence to pin the blame on another death god. That's something that an Abyssal Prefect cannot accomplish.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Among all of the death gods present, the Harken was constructing the 18 abysses of punishment, while Zhao Yun had to oversee the daily operation of Hell in Qin Ye's absence, and Arthis certainly couldn't leave the six paths of reincarnation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's decided then.\" Qin Ye wasn't one to waste time with unnecessary deliberation, and he rose to his feet as he said, \"Flesh out the plan further prior to my return, and devise two plans, one for if my trip to the Nipponese Underworld proves to be successful, and the second one in case of failure. I'll give all of you an answer within the next two months.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\"</span></p>"

The words \"White Deer Pass\" were inscribed on a plaque at the top of the city wall in free-flowing text, and there were countless searchlights in front of the wall, illuminating an area with a radius of several hundred meters in front of the city.

If I were to try and take any of my past troops with me, I'm willing to bet that Governor Qin would immediately report me to Everburn, or perhaps even execute me on the spot before reporting what he had done.

If I can't even extrapolate all of that, then I don't deserve to be sent to Hanyang.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"My apologies, I allowed my emotions to get the better of me,\" the young man sighed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an extremely precious opportunity, and they were terrified of not living up to Qin Ye's expectations.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I can't help but feel like Yanluo Qin is planning a big move.\" The middle-aged man finally broke his silence. \"What do you think Yanluo Qin's intentions are, Gongjin?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In other words, why had he suddenly decided to use the 12 envoys, and why had he chosen to send Zhou Yu to Hanyang?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Yu shook his head in silence, offering no reply.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was no idiot. In fact, among the 12 envoys, he was the one who kept most up to date with current affairs, and he had an inkling of what Qin Ye wanted to do, but he didn't dare to be certain.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Could it be that he wants to take down the Nipponese Underworld? But this is no longer the era of chaos and war in the underworld, this is an era of peace in the wake of the establishment of the Coalition of Underworlds! Can the Cathayan Underworld really afford to initiate a war with the intention of wiping out an entire nation at a time like this? Does it really have the power to take down the Nipponese Underworld? The Nipponese Underworld may be lacking in top-end power, but it's been standing for thousands of years, and its creation-grade divine artifacts are definitely no joke...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Yu could only lament his unwise decision to try and take advantage of the fall of the old Hell. Otherwise, he would've still been in the central circle of power and been privy to this information.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yang Jiye and Yu Qian definitely knew Qin Ye's plans, but there was no way that they were going to tell him. However...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on his face as a sharp look surfaced in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Qin Ye really did want a navy so that he could wage war against the Nipponse Underworld, then he was going to give him an invincible navy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If his assumptions were correct, then this would be his chance to make a resurgence!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">………………………………………………..</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mortal realm, Nippon, Tokyo, Chuo City, Akashicho 9-1.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a triangular building situated among a cluster of tall skyscrapers. On the outside, its appearance was quite understated, but everyone who lived nearby knew that on the internet, this place was known was Nippon's number one hospital, St. Luke's International Hospital.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This private hospital had a history of over 100 years, and it was constructed by Rudolf Teusler. The interior of the hospital didn't look as if it belonged in a hospital at all, with beige walls and decor, and a pronounced minimalist Nipponese style. All of the rooms were constructed extremely well, and all of the beds were multi-purpose mattresses that could also double as sickbeds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a brightly lit room on the top floor arranged&nbsp;in an extremely lavish Europa style, with replicas of famous artworks hanging on the walls, and the carpet on the floor was so soft that it felt like stepping on clouds. As an extremely thoughtful design element that prevented patients from having direct artificial light shone down upon them, all of the light fixtures were hidden in inconspicuous places, yet the room didn't feel dim at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the most luxurious ward in the entirety of St. Luke's International Hospital. The ward couldn't be reserved with money alone, and the patients that it housed were always either extremely wealthy or of exceedingly high status.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was where Iwasaki Kyōya was staying.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was at an extremely advanced age of 92. The average life expectancy in Nippon was very high, so he wasn't an uncommon case. However, it was very remarkable that he still hadn't gone senile at this age and still retained the ability to take care of business matters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, that was all in the past.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya's face was riddled with liver spots, and he was looking up at the ceiling through slightly murky eyes. His face had become far more wizened than when Qin Ye had last seen him. He was wearing an oxygen mask, and a woman in expensive clothing was holding his hand, dabbing at her non-existent tears, surrounded by their children and grandchildren.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A derisive sneer appeared on his face beneath the oxygen mask. Would there still be so many people here if it weren't for his massive estate that was waiting to be inherited?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the first half of the year, he had suffered a fall, and all of the symptoms of his advanced age overcame him at once. All of the suppressed illnesses and the feebleness brought on by organ deterioration were combining to drag him closer and closer to the abyss of death.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He cast his gaze toward his adopted son, Iwasaki Ichiro. This was his driver, and he wasn't a prominent figure in the family, but he always appeared when his adopted father needed him most.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just you watch... My will is going to give all of you a nasty surprise! I'm not so senile that I'm unable to distinguish who has my best interests at heart and who only has eyes for my money. Don't think that you'll get the last laugh even when I'm dead!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He closed his eyes with a smile on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time passed by very quickly, and not many more people came to visit him in his ward. All of his children and grandchildren were busy fighting over his inheritance, and it was clear to all of them that he really wasn't going to make it this time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Soon, the only one left by his bedside was Iwasaki Ichiro.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His illness was very simple: it was organ deterioration. It was an illness born from old age, and it was terminal. Even St. Luke's International Hospital couldn't help him, all they could ensure was that he would live out the rest of his few days in relative comfort.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ever since he moved into the hospital, he had been more energetic. After all, all he did was lie on a bed every day. After dinner earlier in the day, he took a short nap, and he couldn't fall asleep, even though it was already midnight.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He turned to Iwasaki Ichiro before scribbling the words \"I want to go out for a walk\" onto the palm of his hand with his finger.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Ichiro shook his head in response. \"It's too windy outside, but we can stand by the window and take a look outside.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as Iwasaki Ichiro was about to help him out of bed, all of the light fixtures in the room suddenly flashed momentarily before being snuffed out in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cautious gleam flashed through Iwasaki Ichiro's eyes as he reflexively pulled out a gun and positioned himself in front of the bed. At the same time, a youthful voice rang out from within the darkness. \"Long time no see, Mr. Iwasaki. So you've reached the end of your lifespan as well... How unfortunate.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A wistful tone crept into the voice as it spoke.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya brows furrowed slightly upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could swear that he had heard this voice before, but he couldn't remember where...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gently tugged on Iwasaki Ichiro's sleeve, trying to tell him not to shoot, but he was unable to speak due to his condition.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Don't shoot.\" All of a sudden, his raspy voice rang out, and he was momentarily stunned by the sound of his own voice before looking down at his own body with an incredulous expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this instant, he felt as if he had returned to the peak of his powers!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His energy and bodily condition had all returned to same state as back in his thirties, and he immediately tore off the oxygen mask before taking several deep breaths of fresh air in succession.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"May I ask which esteemed guest has come to visit me?\" His chest was heaving violently as he swept an intense gaze around the room, and in the next instant, all of the lights in the room lit up in unison, revealing a person seated on the sofa.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a young man, and he waved at Iwasaki Kyōya with a smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya's brows furrowed slightly as he stared intently at the young man, and a few seconds later, he drew a sharp breath as a memory from over 20 years ago surfaced in his mind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Mr. Qin?\" He took a deep breath before extending a deep bow. \"Can you... save me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm afraid I can't,\" Qin Ye sighed. \"You only had a month left to live, and all I can do is allow you to live in this state for two weeks. No one is able to break the cycle of the Heavenly Dao.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya heaved a disappointed sigh upon hearing this, but his eyes soon lit up again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Being able to live for two weeks in this state was already beyond his wildest dreams!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he had a choice, he definitely wouldn't want to die the slow and tortured death that he was inevitably heading toward.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"My apologies, I was too greedy,\" he said with a smile. \"Ichiro, tell my lawyers to come and see me tomorrow afternoon! Also, making a booking at Minokichi Honten Takeshigerō! I have important matters to discuss with Mr. Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Minokichi Honten Takeshigerō was the best kaiseki-ryōri restaurant in Tokyo, and it was also a business under the Mitsubishi Corporation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Ichiro immediately rushed over to help Iwasaki Kyōya put on his clothes, only to be pushed aside by the latter. He couldn't remember the last time his body had felt this good!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Would you do me the honor of dining with me, Mr. Qin?\" he asked as he extended another deep bow toward Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course,\" Qin Ye replied with a smile. \"I came here today to see off an old friend, and also to discuss some matters that'll come up after your death.

Thus, he could only turn to Daehan's backer, which was the Ming Dynasty empire at the time, for reinforcements.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Wanli Emperor was very displeased to hear about what Nippon had done, and thus, Song Yingchang and Li Rusong were deployed alongside an army of 40,000 troops to reinforce Daehan, comprehensively crushing Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army of 150,000.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time, the morale of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army was at an all-time high. It had just united all of Nippon, and it was quite a formidable army, but unfortunately for them, cannons had just been invented in the Ming Dynasty empire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the battle became completely unfair. By modern standards, cannons back in those days were inaccurate and lacking in firepower, but don't forget that they were being pitted against soldiers who were only equipped with primitive weapons like swords and spears!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army stepped onto the battlefield, it was hit by a barrage of unknown steel balls, and the battle was quickly over.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Five years later, Toyotomi Hideyoshi decided to have a second try, and the outcome was much the same. Through those two battles, Toyotomi Hideyoshi's forces were dealt irrecoverable blows.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time, Toyotomi Hideyoshi's reign was forged on the foundation of the five major subordinates under him, namely Tokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshiie, Ukita Hideie, &nbsp;Mōri Terumoto, and Kobayakawa Takakage. During the two Daehan wars, three of those clans suffered heavy losses, and as a result, Tokugawa Ieyasu became the most powerful of the five subordinates due to the fact that he had always conserved his own forces. Thus, the foundation was set for Tokugawa Ieyasu's subsequent rise to power.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tokugawa Ieyasu heaved a long sigh. \"So long as Izanami continues to be in power, none of us will truly be free.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire hall fell silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the root of the conflict between the daimyos and the gods and demons.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's not even to mention Ashikaga Yoshiaki...\" Honda Tadakatsu said in a resentful voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time in the underworld passed like sand in an eternal hourglass. The sand was constantly slipping away, but no one could sense its departure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Half a year passed by in the blink of an eye, and for underworld emissaries like Honda Tadakatsu, it seemed like nothing had changed, but all of the top rulers of the Asian underworlds were beginning to pay special attention to their calendars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Starting from the beginning of the month, the Golden Temple of the underworld became extremely busy. This temple existed in the mortal realm as well, and it was in Hindustan, a nation where religion was extremely revered. Thus, most of the important religious landmarks of Hindustan in the mortal realm were replicated in the underworld as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Golden Temple of the underworld was even more massive than the one in the mortal realm. In Hindustan, the Golden Temple had been constructed using 750 kilograms of gold, but its equivalent in the Hindustani Underworld had been constructed using an entire metric ton of gold! Virtually the entirety of the interior was constructed from pure gold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, there was a woman with a thin veil over her face, wearing a five-colored cape, standing at the entrance of the temple.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She was extremely beautiful, and it was clear form her features that she was Hindustani in ethnicity. There were images depicting all types of legends etched onto her cape, and she looked just like an ordinary woman from the mortal realm, but no one dared to look down on her.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This woman was none other than the Sky Serpent King!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Among all of the Hindustani Underworld's death gods, she was the one closest to the advanced Yama-King level, and she was also the prime minister of the Hindustani Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her smile was impeccable, and there was a line of Yin spirit servants with white turbans on their heads standing behind her. She raised her head as she asked, \"How long until Yanluo Qin arrives?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No more than five minutes,\" one of the servants replied.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Sky Serpent King nodded in response and didn't say anything further.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She knew that this conference was not going to be a simple affair. Each international conference was an opportunity for underworlds to fight for speaking rights, and in particular, the Cathayan Underworld was attending this conference as the second host.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, the Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference had two host nations, and this was due to the fact that Asia was the only continent in the entire underworld with two members of the four pillars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless pairs of eyes were focused on this place, and everyone wanted to see what moves the Cathayan Underworld was going to make during this conference.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After all, it was their first time hosting an international conference since their century-long absence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The servant paused momentarily before continuing in a hesitant voice, \"Also, there's something else I need to tell you about.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What were you doing before this?</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Sky Serpent King's brows furrowed slightly upon hearing this, and the servant hurriedly explained, \"This is something that was raised by Mistress Izanami less than 10 minutes ago, so we've only just been informed as well...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Go ahead,\" the Sky Serpent King urged before the servant had a chance to finish.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The servant pursed his lips, then said, \"There will be two Nipponese representative teams attending this conference.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Sky Serpent King's body remained completely still, but her head swiveled around 90 degrees, and three snakes slowly converged toward the center of her pupils as she asked in a frosty voice, \"Why have you only just been informed of this?! Tell me what's going on!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The servant felt as if his soul had been plunged into a glacial pit, and he hurriedly explained, \"One of the representative teams is led by Izanami and Ashikaga Yoshiaki, while the other one is led by Tokugawa Ieyasu, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Hōjō Tokimune, and Honda Tadakatsu.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They're not led by Izanami?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Then what right do they have to attend this conference?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They also have letters of invitation...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Sky Serpent King's fury instantly faded, and her eyes narrowed slightly in a calculating manner as she asked, \"Who sent them their letters of invitation?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They were from the Cathayan Underworld,\" the servant replied. \"We haven't prepared any places for them to rest, nor any seats for them in the conference venue. Should we...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Allow them to participate in the conference,\" the Sky Serpent King said in an indifferent voice. \"This is the Nipponese Underworld's issue. All parties with letters of invitation are allowed entry. Also, make sure to reprimand Izanami for not clarifying the number of representative teams from her nation in advance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes.\" The servant released a messenger bird into the air, and at the same time, the Sky Serpent King's eyes abruptly sprang open as a warm smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the end of the road, a giant carriage that was over 10 meters tall and crafted in the form of a Yin beast was slowly approaching the temple.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a moving palace.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even all of the bells hanging outside the carriage were extremely intricate, having been crafted entirely from underworld gold, and the carriage itself was constructed from the A-grade material, Linglong Crystal, which was able to withstand 10 Yama-King level attacks. That wasn't even to mention the top-tier Yin runes inscribed upon it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a foreign death god, she was very envious of the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even she couldn't understand these Yin runes, so they had to be Yin runes from the 10th circle, and only King Yanluo's Seal could give rise to such Yin runes!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She repressed the envy in her heart as she lifted the hem of her lavish dress, and right as the carriage drew to a halt before her, she extended a deep bow. \"It is my honor to welcome Yanluo Qin to the Hindustani Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Classic Hindustani music had already begun to play, and female dancers on either side began to dance along to the music.

The garden had become his own personal hell, and Honda Tadakatsu reflexively stumbled back before drawing a sharp breath. \"You're a Yama-King?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During his last visit to Nippon, Qin Ye had concealed his Yin energy, and it never occurred to Honda Tadakatsu that he could've been a high-grade underworld emissary. He had thought that Qin Ye would be around the same level as him, which was the mid-Infernal Judge level. By his reasoning, even at the very most, Qin Ye still wouldn't have been an Abyssal Prefect.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">To him, it was like seeing an old friend on the street and giving him a friendly slap on the back. However, it seemed that he had made a severe lapse in judgment...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Qin Ye slowly turned around, Honda Tadakatsu continued to stumble back with his mouth gaped wide open in shock. He reflexively made a grabbing motion, upon which Tonbokiri returned to his grasp, and the entire shaft of the spear was trembling gently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How did you find me?\" Countless Yin winds had gathered behind Qin Ye to form a terrifying vortex, within which lost souls were howling incessantly. With each step that he took, the Yin energy around him would ripple violently, and countless fallen leaves were shrieking through the air like kites with severed strings.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With each step that he took, Honda Tadakatsu would take a step backward, and only as his back crashed into a tree did he return to his senses, following which he asked through gritted teeth, \"Is this how you greet an old friend?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Since when were we friends?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye watched him through narrowed eyes for a few seconds before abruptly withdrawing his Yin energy. He suddenly recalled that Honda Tadakatsu had once told him that if he were willing to rule over Nippon, he would be willing to serve him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Could it be that he was serious?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yama-King level Yin energy could crush an Infernal Judge to a pulp, so it was a massive relief to Honda Tadakatsu once Qin Ye withdrew his Yin energy. He looked directly at Qin Ye as he explained, \"We've both touched the Book of Life and Death before, so we can sense one another if we try. Have you not noticed that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye closed his eyes and tried to sense Honda Tadakatsu, upon which he discovered that it really was the case.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, he could clearly sense the Book of Life and Death. There were many Infernal Judge level Yin spirits in the Book of Life and Death, but he had never carefully inspected them as Yin spirits of that level simply didn't attract his interest.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why are you here to see me?\" he asked as he slowly clenched his fists behind his back.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't sure whether he should kill Honda Tadakatsu or not.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I thought we were friends,\" Honda Tadakatsu replied as he looked right back at Qin Ye. \"My fiefdom, Feathersheen City, lies beneath Tokyo, and I thought I should invite you to my home for some hospitality. I've already prepared a banquet for you in Feathersheen City.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several seconds later, Qin Ye smiled as he said, \"I thought you were only kidding at the time.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, it seemed that Honda Tadakatsu had taken their conversation seriously.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, Qin Ye wasn't so immature, but if he were to leave now, he would arouse suspicions from Honda Tadakatsu. This trip to Nippon was strictly confidential, and he didn't want any unnecessary trouble.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, the fact that Honda Tadakatsu's fiefdom in the underworld was equivalent to Tokyo in the mortal realm was a clear indication that he was an extremely important figure in the Nipponese Underworld, so he could be a valuable source of information.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So what would you like to do now?\" Honda Tadakatsu asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Well, it would be rude not to accept an invitation from an old friend, would it not?\" Qin Ye replied with a smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">10 minutes later, Qin Ye was standing in front of a large shrine, inspecting his surroundings with a rather surprised expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The shrine was situated in Yoyogi, Tokyo, and it was surrounded by a vast forest, which was the largest area of greenery in the central area of Tokyo, spanning the entire area between Yoyogi and Harajuku, which amounted to a total of 70 hectares. Inside this forest was the number one Shinto shrine of Nippon, Meiji Jingu.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken were the ones worshiped in Meiji Jingu, and it could be said that this was the head temple of the Shinto religion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only an extremely important figure to the Nipponese Underworld would possess an inter-realm mirror here. It seemed that Honda Tadakatsu's status in the Nipponese Underworld was even loftier than Qin Ye had expected.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was already past 3 AM at this point, but there were still lit candles on the candlesticks outside the shrine, as if to provide guidance to the lost souls wandering through limbo. The shrine was extremely majestic, but there was something a little eerie about it at the moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Honda Tadakatsu pulled back the sleeve of his kimono as he made an inviting hand gesture, then led the way into the shrine.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They passed through the entrance and several corridors, arriving in a room with seals on&nbsp;the doors. The interior of the room was extremely tidy, and there was a black vase that was around a meter in height with lush plum blossoms inside situated in each of the four corners. At the center of the wall was a mirror.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a floor-to-ceiling mirror that was roughly three meters tall and two meters wide. At the foot of the mirror were statues of the Hyakki Yagyō, while carvings of Izanami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto were present on top of the mirror. The mirror's surface was incredibly smooth and pristine, but it was incapable of reflection.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an inter-realm mirror!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a long look at it before stepping into the mirror together with Honda Tadakatsu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a brief rush of dizziness, Qin Ye slowly opened his eyes, and he was greeted by the sight of a large city in the form of a tenshu pavilion in the classic style of the Nipponese Sengoku period.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the center was the inner citadel, and it was over 100 meters tall with the emblem of the Honda clan hanging at the center, surrounded by countless specks of netherfire. Situated around the inner citadel were four smaller branch tenshu pavilions that were connected by passageways that were suspended in mid-air, and at this moment, the entire tenshu pavilion was brightly lit.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Welcome to Feathersheen City!\" Honda Tadakatsu smiled as he extended a slight bow. \"I came into possession of this city a century ago, and after what happened at the Strait of Tsushima last time, I received the rights to expand it.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right in front of them was an altar, upon which was a faintly glowing teleportation array formed by Yin runes. The two of them stepped onto the array, and they quickly arrived in a spacious room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a classic antiquated Nipponese-style room, and it was very large, looking to be around 200 to 300 square meters in area. There was a bamboo curtain hanging in front of each seat, and a group of kabuki dancers were already gathered and ready to perform on the tatami mats at the center of the room. Right as Qin Ye sat down, the instrumentals began, and it was at just the right volume, clearly audible, but not loud enough to hinder&nbsp;conversation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The bamboo curtains were pulled up by the servants off to the side, and Honda Tadakatsu picked up his black sake cup with a smile. \"I didn't think I would ever meet you again, Qin San, and it's certainly a massive surprise to me that you've already become a Yama-King. Let's drink to that.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I also didn't think that you would've already become a daimyo.\" Qin Ye took a sip of his sake, then set down his cup with a reminiscent look in his eyes. \"I still remember everything that happened at the Strait of Tsushima as clearly as if it were yesterday, but over two decades have already passed since then.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Indeed...\" Honda Tadakatsu sighed. \"Almost all of the daimyos at the time were punished. Out of the 54 daimyos, 42 were demoted, and they were allowed to keep their tenshu pavilions, but were forced to reduce the number of troops in their private armies.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's expression changed slightly upon hearing this, and he turned to look at Honda Tadakatsu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Honda Tadakatsu was watching the dancers and sampling a piece of sashimi, seemingly completely oblivious to what he had just said.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Firstly, a daimyo wasn't an official post. During the Sengoku era of Nippon, anyone could receive the title of daimyo so long as they had sufficient territory, troops, and wealth. There were different levels among daimyos, with the lowliest ones roughly equivalent in rank to junior assistant ministers, while the most prominent ones, such as Takeda Shingen of Kai Province, Uesugi Kenshin of Echigo Province, and Oda Nobunaga of Owari Province were roughly equivalent to the likes of the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: -0.16px; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">Minister of the Center or the Major Counselor</span></span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This made sense considering Toyotomi Hideyoshi declared himself to be a regent&nbsp;as soon as he united the nation, thus making him the head of Nippon, and he was a daimyo prior to that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Honda Tadakatsu didn't appear to have said anything significant, but in reality, he had just revealed the internal conflict between the system of gods and demons and the system of daimyos in the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In reality, there were always signs of this internal conflict present if one knew where to look. For example, why wasn't there even a single god or demon present back at the Strait of Tsushima? Why was it that only daimyos had been present?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was most likely the case that the daimyo system was inferior to the system of gods and demons. After all, Izanami wasn't part of the daimyo system. With that in mind, Qin Ye took another glance at Honda Tadakatsu, wondering if he had intentionally said this or if it had just been an errant thought that he had expressed out loud.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye smiled as he took a sip of sake, but his mind was racing as he said, \"It looks like the daimyos don't have it easy, either. The regime seems to be quite restrictive and oppressive toward daimyos. Does that apply to you as well?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It does...\" Honda Tadakatsu sighed. \"On the surface, it looks like I have it all, but in reality... Hehe...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both of them fell silent there.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was becoming more and more confused about Honda Tadakatsu's mindset. In the past, he had told Honda Tadakatsu that he was the future heir to the Cathayan Underworld's King Yanluo, and he was certain that Honda Tadakatsu wouldn't forget something like that. Now that Qin Ye had become a Yama-King, he couldn't help but wonder how he was being regarded by Honda Tadakatsu.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Was he saying all of this in an attempt to initiate an exchange of information, or was he just lamenting about his situation to what he perceived to be an old friend?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was extremely important as it reflected the attitude of the daimyos in response to an invasion from the Cathayan Underworld. The daimyos of the Sengoku period were a force to be reckoned with, and if they were willing to defect to the Cathayan Underworld, that would naturally be extremely welcome. Thus, if possible, Qin Ye really wanted to absorb them into the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the moment, the two of them were like a pair of crickets touching one another with their feelers, but not directly expressing their true intentions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After several seconds of silence, Qin Ye smiled as he said, \"Perhaps some things will change in half a year's time.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Oh?\" Honda Tadakatsu picked up his cup to hide the hint of excitement that flashed through his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"In half a year, I'm going to hold an Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Honda Tadakatsu sighed, \"We most likely won't have the right to attend the conference.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Not necessarily,\" Qin Ye said. \"When the time comes, I'll be sending invitations to Tokugawa Ieyasu, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Hōjō Tokimune, and yourself. Izanami wouldn't dare to refuse.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the surface, it appeared that Qin Ye was helping him or that he was widening the rift between the daimyos and the gods and demons, but at the same time, he was also implying that this was the reason why he had come to Nippon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was visiting to see which people he wanted to invite.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps this was an absurd reason. After all, no one would believe that a Yama-King would come to Nippon in person over such a trivial matter, but at the very least, it was a somewhat plausible excuse.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As for what happened next...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye set down his cup.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once Qin Ye confirmed that the Mitsubishi Corporation and the daimyos were interested in a deeper collaborative partnership, he would have to find opportunities to initiate contact with those parties.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These things couldn't be rushed. If he were to do things too hastily, his plans could be exposed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had already reaped sufficient rewards from this trip to Nippon, and it would be unwise to try and pursue much more than this.</span></p>"

As soon as he left, Iwasaki Ichiro immediately stood up with a concerned expression. \"Sir, are you alright?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya gently pushed his hand aside before rising to his feet. \"I'm fine.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Ichiro opened his mouth several times, but didn't say anything in the end.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya adjusted his own clothes, then said, \"Do you want to say that there's no need for me to fear him?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to reply, Iwasaki Kyōya sighed, \"You know far too little about that world. Do you know what Yama-Kings are? The most powerful underworld emissaries in the Nipponese Underworld are only Abyssal Prefects, and according to my knowledge, Yama-Kings stand above Abyssal Prefects. In the entire underworld, there are only several dozen Yama-Kings in total. They are the true rulers of the other world, and I'm about to go there soon. How can I not be afraid?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Also...\" He raised a hand before clenching it into a tight fist, and veins bulged on his wizened arm. \"After experiencing the feeling of youth, no one would want to return to old age! Make the preparations for an evocation tonight!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, he immediately departed.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Three days passed by in the blink of an eye. On the second day, the entirety of the Mitsubishi Corporation was given a massive shock by the announcement of Iwasaki Kyōya's will. At 12 AM on the third day, Iwasaki Kyōya was already seated on his own in a booth in Takeshigerō.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye hadn't left Iwasaki Kyōya with any means to contact him, but he knew that Qin Ye would definitely be able to find him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as the clock struck 12 AM, a gust of Yin wind slowly took shape in front of him, and several seconds later, Qin Ye had already appeared on the seat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In front of them was a lavish meal, with top-grade sushi that had been made no more than two minutes ago. The fish that was sitting on the rice hadn't even been warmed by the heat of the rice yet, but no one was in the mood to sample it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya extended a deep bow, but didn't immediately say anything. Instead, he spread open a piece of parchment paper, and the names of three people appeared on it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye, Iwasaki Kyōya, and Iwasaki Yatarō.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's expression changed slightly upon seeing this. Even as the ruler of a nation, he felt a hint of admiration toward Iwasaki Yatarō.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the man who had once dominated the entirety of the shipbuilding and ship freight industries in Asia. Furthermore, he had singlehandedly founded the Mitsubishi Corporation, spreading its name far and wide throughout Nippon and even every single corner of Asia.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You've already met your ancestor?\" Qin Ye asked as he picked up his cup of sake before taking a sip.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I have.\" Iwasaki Kyōya extended a deep bow before pulling a paper cutout out of his pocket, then said with a careful expression, \"My ancestor wishes to speak to you in person.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't dare to say anything further because the first thing that Iwasaki Yatarō had said after descending through evocation was: \"You're telling me a Yama-King came to Nippon and specifically came to our Mitsubishi Corporation? Who are you kidding?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In his mind, a Yama-King should've been pursuing a collaboration with entities like the Sacred Treasure Consortium. The Mitsubishi Corporation was extremely powerful in the mortal realm, but it didn't have much influence at all in the underworld, so why would a Yama-King come to seek them out in person?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye casually nodded in response, and Iwasaki Kyōya took a deep breath before pulling out a small silver blade, with which he gently sliced open his own finger, allowing his blood to drip onto the paper cutout. The drop of blood was like gasoline on fire, instantly igniting a burst of blue netherfire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figure rose unsteadily to its feet, then inspected its surroundings in a very humanized gesture. In the instant that it caught sight of Qin Ye, its legs clearly trembled, following which it fell to its knees on the table and kowtowed with all its might as it greeted in a trembling voice, \"It is the utmost honor for me to be in your presence, Yanluo Qin!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the dogeza pose, one that was used in Nippon to express the utmost respect or apology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya's pupils contracted drastically upon seeing this. Never did he think that Iwasaki Yatarō, who was revered like a god by the entire Iwasaki Family, would choose to adopt such a pose in the instant that he saw Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he immediately reacted. Given what Iwasaki Yatarō was doing, there was certainly no way that he could just keep on sitting. That would be a massive act of disrespect to both Qin Ye and his ancestor!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, Iwasaki Kyōya quickly adopted the dogeza pose as well, and he stared intently down at the tatami mat beneath him, wondering why his ancestor was putting on such a lowly display. What was it about this particular Yama-King that made him so special?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figure paid no heed to Iwasaki Kyōya's thoughts. In reality, it was even more stunned than Iwasaki Kyōya. Never did it think that the Yama-King in question would be the Cathayan Underworld's King Yanluo!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That, in addition to the Heavenly Dao scroll from earlier, immediately ignited a scorching flame in his heart!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the silence, Qin Ye smiled and asked, \"You recognize me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I do! You are the ruler of the Cathayan Underworld, the third King Yanluo, the leader of one of the underworld's four pillars!\" Iwasaki Yatarō was intentionally rattling off these titles for Iwasaki Kyōya to hear. \"I wouldn't dare to say that I'm familiar with you, but I was fortunate enough to have caught a glimpse of you from afar during the conference in Nara, and from that point on, I never dared to forget your face!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You were granted access to the conference in Nara?\" Qin Ye asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Yatarō replied, \"The ships that welcomed all of the underworlds at the conference in Nara was the biggest order our Mitsubishi Corporation had received in the past decade.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I see.

They haven't kept much of an eye on the development of the mortal realm during the past century. After all, a century is far too short a period of time in the underworld. The field that we chose to pursue was submarine construction. For people like us, even in the mortal realm, we had some connections in the underworld. Not everyone is content with the Sacred Treasure Consortium's monopoly over the shipbuilding and sea freight industries. Currently, our Mitsubishi Consortium of the underworld has three major investors who are supporting us in our submarine endeavors. However, this is a very difficult piece of technology to develop, and over the past three years, we've only managed to complete half of the research. If you can give us another five years, I'm fairly confident that we should be able to develop the first generation of submarines.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye shook his head in response. \"I want a definitive answer.

If the Mitsubishi Consortium could make a significant contribution in this war, then its status in the Nipponese Underworld would undoubtedly be massively elevated!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, if they were to do this, then they would be betraying the Nipponese Underworld.

If we aren't able to do that, we'll take all of the members of the Iwasaki Family in the Nipponese Underworld to the Cathayan Underworld. At the same time, I'll convince the Cathayan government to accept the immigration applications of all of the important members of the Iwasaki Family in the mortal realm. Even if the plan fails, you'll be Yin spirits of our Cathayan Underworld, and Izanami wouldn't dare to do anything to you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He paused momentarily before continuing, \"Of course, if you can provide the submarines, there's no way this plan will fail.

Finally, it said in a determined voice, \"Alright, then we'll take a gamble!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You won't regret this decision,\" Qin Ye said with a faint smile. \"The Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference will be held in half a year, and when that time comes, you'll receive your first present from me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I look forward to it!\" Seeing as a decision had already been made, there was no room for Iwasaki Yatarō to backtrack now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During this meeting, their intention to collaborate had been established, but as for the finer details of the plan, those would have to be fleshed out through frequent interactions and exchanges of all types of information between the two parties, and these exchanges had to be facilitated by suitable opportunities.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the moment, the Cathayan Underworld hadn't opened itself up to any other nation. Formosa was its only foreign affairs outpost, and if the Cathayan Underworld were to suddenly become too close with the Mitsubishi Corporation, that would attract a lot of unwanted suspicion and attention.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A buildup was required for everything, and only once everything was ready would it be time to initiate the plan, particularly when it came to a major operation to bring down a nation that would take years to complete.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With everything decided, Qin Ye heaved an internal sigh of relief before raising his cup. \"I propose a toast to commemorate our first collaboration.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Cheers.\" Iwasaki Kyōya was still reeling from what he had just seen, and he hurriedly also raised his cup before downing his sake in one go. \"May I ask how long you'll be staying in Nippon, Mr. Qin?

Every single table was situated in rooms with exceptional privacy, and the classic Nipponese-style construction, soft tatami mats, and faint incense fragrance in the air gave the entire place a Zen-filled aura.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was already 1 AM, clearly not within business hours, but those rules only applied to the majority, and there were always some people who transcended beyond the rules.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya was clearly among that type of people.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One delectable dish after another was brought on, and despite the late hour, the entire restaurant was brightly lit. The hostess of the restaurant was wearing a beautiful kimono and an equally gorgeous smile. The tip for this meal alone exceeded a million NPY, and she couldn't help but smile at the image of Fukuzawa Yukichi on the 10,000 NPY bills.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya closed his eyes with a blissful expression as he swallowed a mouthful of bluefin tuna belly. The intramuscular fat was completely devoid of any undesirable flavors, and it felt like heaven as it melted in his mouth. Only after basking in the blissful sensation for a long while did Iwasaki Kyōya set down his chopsticks.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's been far too long since I've felt something like this.\" He raised a hand, and Iwasaki Ichiro immediately picked up a pristine, warm towel before wiping his hand in a respectful manner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Ever since I was admitted into the hospital, all I could eat was congee that had been boiled into mush.

He knew that Qin Ye definitely had to be someone from the \"other side\". Having been with Iwasaki Kyōya for close to 20 years, he had seen far too many unfathomable things.

He was already prepared to lie on the deathbed and wait for his demise, yet he now had two weeks at the peak of his physical condition. He couldn't wait to see everyone's reactions once he declared his will the next day.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Please pardon my rudeness.\" He extended a deep bow while supporting himself with his hands on his knees. \"I didn't get to learn your identity last time, Mr. Qin.

Iwasaki Ichiro almost sprang to his feet upon seeing this, but he was held down by Iwasaki Kyōya.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that instant, it was as if they had entered the depths of hell, but in the next instant, everything faded like an illusion, and only then did Qin Ye reply, \"I am a Yama-King of the Cathayan Underworld, Qin Ye.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A Yama-King?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya's eyes sprang wide open with shock upon hearing this. As the leader of one of the six major corporations that were supporting Nippon,he knew exactly what the term \"Yama-King\" entailed. It meant that Qin Ye was standing at the very peak of the pyramid in the Cathayan Underworld's power hierarchy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I must say, this is quite a surprise.\" He took a deep breath, and his mind was racing as he said, \"I am honored to be in your presence. It's a pity that it won't be easy for us to meet again once I enter the underworld. I wonder if immigration is possible in the underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye smiled once again as he gently traced a finger over the rim of his cup. \"You sure like to talk in roundabout ways, Mr. Iwasaki.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that he wanted to hang onto Qin Ye's coattails. His fear of an unknown world was entirely understandable. If he could establish a connection with a Yama-King, it would be far better than having to go to the Nipponese Underworld alone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Actually...

It was clear that he was here to make some type of proposal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm listening.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a wave of Qin Ye's hand, the entire restaurant was silently enveloped in Yin runes so that no one would be able to eavesdrop on their conversation. Only then did he lean forward as he said, \"Before that, I have a question for you. Does the Mitsubishi Corporation have a foundation in the Nipponese Underworld?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya's smile faded as he asked, \"How will my answer influence this discussion?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye leaned back against his chair in a casual manner as he replied, \"If the answer is yes, then I need a favor from you.

The influence that they have on the Nipponese Underworld cannot be understated, and there's simply no chance for us to overtake them!

Before you find your ancestors, make sure to keep the Heavenly Dao scroll with you at all times. Otherwise, believe me when I say that I can take back everything that I gave you in an instant!\"</span></p>"

Every single pillar and even the dome-shaped roof was covered in gold foil, and a series of extremely life-like statues and renowned ancient Hindustani artworks were perfectly embedded within them, giving the entire hall both a sense of beauty and majesty.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A tall platform stood at the center of the hall with the ruler death gods of the four pillars seated on it. Behind them were the flags of all of the nations in the Coalition of Underworlds. The main platform was surrounded by stairs in all directions, and all of the death gods of the Asia-Pacific, as well as the death gods that had received special invites, were gathered here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Round chandeliers that carried strong religious elements were hanging up above, illuminating the entire hall with gentle yellow radiance. As the candles being held by the Naga statues on either side of the hall were ignited, Yamaraja rose up from his seat before extending a slight bow. \"I am truly very pleased to be able to see so many of you during this conference. Different civilizations give rise to different cultures, and culture is the driving force behind societal development. Here in the underworld, we have unlimited time, and I firmly believe that all cultures that adapt with the natural order will bloom into something beautiful one day. However, during this process, we have to carefully nurture and protect these cultures, and that is why the four pillars came into existence. We are willing to accept the extra responsibility of leading the world forward, and it's also because of this that the Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference arose.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was already very accustomed to occasions like this, and he gently raised a hand, upon which bursts of Yin energy surged out of his fingertips, forming a series of Yin energy images in the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The images depicted the earliest parts of human civilization, then the industrial revolution and the renaissance.

We'll only need 50 years to complete a journey that the mortal realm took centuries to complete. The combined usage of Yin energy and the new energy resource can be referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, and as the pioneer behind all of this, Yanluo Qin of the Cathayan Underworld is undoubtedly the main character here, so without further ado, we welcome him to deliver his address.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Raucous applause rang out once again, and this wave was far more genuine than the previous one.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld had already become the trade center of Asia.

After thorough deliberation between our Cathayan Underworld's energy resource and finance departments, we've decided that the costs for the new energy resource will be lowered across the board starting from next year.

These funds will be stored in the Cathayan Underworld's Heaven and Earth Bank, and it will temporarily be named the 'energy resource development fund'.

Indeed, the Cathayan Underworld definitely isn't as influential as it once was, so he's planning to strengthen the bond between the Cathayan Underworld and the rest of the world by doing this. He's using the economy to reel in all of the world's death gods, then using the energy resource research fund to attract all of the world's leading scientists.

At the very least, he had to silence the underworlds as much as possible, and these concessions were what he was using to keep everyone quiet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was also the first step to stripping away the Nipponese Underworld's defenses prior to initiating the war.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were all types of expenses required for an invasion, and those expenses really could add up. As an example, in the mortal realm, Usonia's economy had been heavily affected during its war efforts, even though it was only fighting the Middle East, and Qin Ye definitely didn't want to replicate that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What an inspiring speech!

As soon as the conclusion of the morning meeting was declared, all of the ruler death gods of the Asian underworlds immediately rushed toward Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yanluo Qin.\" Izanami hurried over to Qin Ye's side with a smile. \"I am truly in awe and admiration of the Cathayan Underworld's generosity.

It would be a great honor for me if I could have lunch with you, Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye turned to her with a smile and replied, \"I'm also very happy to plan out the economic blueprint of Asia with the Nipponese Underworld. The Nipponese Underworld is undoubtedly an indispensable part of the Asian economy. However, I think this discussion should take place between the major companies and organizations of our two nations, rather than our governments.

In reality, that was the expected outcome. After all, the Nipponese Underworld had acted as the spearhead for the three pillars for so long, and these things were not forgiven so easily.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What really frustrated her was that what Qin Ye was doing essentially completely kept out the demons and gods of the Nipponese Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had explicitly chosen the daimyos to work with, and the Cathayan Underworld controlled the entire assessment process, which meant that only the daimyos would be granted the base station construction rights! Her intention was to invite Qin Ye to lunch so that she could try and convince Qin Ye to include the demons and gods in the deal as well, but he had turned her down decisively.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There's no need to be too upset,\" Daitengu said. \"The Cathayan Underworld is clearly trying to exacerbate the conflict between the two major domestic factions of our nation, but just as you said, we've been abandoned and left out to dry by the three pillars. As a small nation, we have to learn to survive within the cracks. The three pillars have abandoned us, so our top priority right now is to mend our relationship with the Cathayan Underworld. Even if the demons and gods aren't involved, it's still a good thing that we can establish a connection with the Cathayan Underworld through the daimyos. Isn't that the exact same reason you implemented that policy a while back, allowing tourists from the Cathayan Underworld to visit our Nipponese Underworld without visas? Some compromises must be made, we can't always expect perfect outcomes.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami heaved a faint sigh. \"Looks like I was a little too greedy.

However, the Cathayan Underworld hadn't invited any ruler death gods. Instead, they had invited the ministries of commerce of those nations.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first ones to enter the conference hall were the three kampakus of the Nipponese Underworld, and everyone was forced to see them through new eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu, Hōjō Tokimune, and Honda Tadakatsu had no attention to spare for all of the envious eyes focused on them.

The daimyos will forever be the most loyal followers of the Cathayan Underworld in the Nipponese Underworld!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Take a seat.\" Qin Ye smiled as he made an inviting hand gesture, and four daimyos did as they were told. Qin Ye then waved a hand through the air, releasing countless Yin runes, and said, \"I don't like to waste time going around in circles. What could be so important that the three most influential daimyos in Nipponese history have decided to contact me? And why were you being so subtle with what you were trying to say?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He really did understand!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the daimyos heaved another internal sigh of relief. They had already guessed that Qin Ye had understood what they were trying to convey, but they were still quite relieved to hear it confirmed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We wish to seek help from the Cathayan Underworld.\" Hōjō Tokimune cut straight to the chase. It was clear that they had done their homework, so they were aware that Qin Ye didn't like to waste time with unnecessary small talk. \"We are willing to offer everything we have in return!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye raised an eyebrow upon hearing this, and he released a hint of his Yin energy, filling the entire hall with a menacing atmosphere, which caused the three daimyos to involuntarily sit up straighter.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a wave of his hand, Qin Ye summoned four parchment scrolls to himself, then said in an implacable voice, \"Sign it or get out.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Those are Heavenly Dao vows!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The netherfire in the eyes of three daimyos flickered slightly as they stared at Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a full minute of silence, Honda Tadakatsu imparted his soulfire onto the scroll in front of him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What are you all still hesitating for?\" he asked as he slammed his Heavenly Dao vow onto the table. \"Are you going to just pass up this opportunity? We've been oppressed and suffocated for several centuries! All of us were heroes in the mortal realm! Are you really willing to continue living like this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Toyotomi Hideyoshi's facial muscles spasmed slightly as he gritted his teeth, then also imparted his soulfire onto his scroll.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye wasn't surprised by their decisions at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Strictly speaking, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu were sworn enemies. After all, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had been fighting on the front lines with Daehan, while Tokugawa Ieyasu had conserved his forces and seized power for himself. The fact that the two of them were willing to sit at the same table for the same cause was already a clear indication of just how important this opportunity was to them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu and Hōjō Tokimune also signed their Heavenly Dao vows one after another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Good.\" Qin Ye put the four scrolls away, then turned to the four underworld emissaries with a bright and piercing gaze. \"Let me ask you this: are you opposed to serving a new ruler death god?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, the four underworld emissaries stood up in unison to stare at Qin Ye with stunned expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never did they think that this was the type of help Qin Ye would be seeking from them!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld was going to initiate a war to conquer the Nipponese Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless emotions were surging through their hearts, and they instinctively wanted to refuse, but they couldn't bring themselves to do so.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they missed out on this opportunity, there would be nothing left for them...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, it wasn't like the Cathayan Underworld wouldn't be able to conquer the Nipponese Underworld without their help.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they were to refuse, then many issues would arise.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Given the current state of the Nipponese Underworld, they would definitely have to go into battle, and there was a very good chance that they would be used as cannon fodder. If they refused to act as cannon fodder, then Izanami would kill them before the war even began. If they were to step onto the battlefield, then they would be enemies of the Cathayan Underworld. The outcome of the war was clear, so they would be downright idiotic if they chose to refuse this offer and become enemies with their future master.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire hall instantly fell deathly silent. This was too important a decision, so much so that they didn't dare to say anything. Only after a long while did Tokugawa Ieyasu find his voice again. \"Once the Cathayan Underworld conquers the Nipponese Underworld, does that mean that the Nipponese Underworld would cease to exist?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't even state the outcome in a hypothetical sense as the outcome was far too clear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No, I won't erase any civilizations,\" Qin Ye replied. \"The Nipponese Underworld will still be allowed to develop independently, while our Cathayan Underworld will only offer political guidance. This arrangement will last a span of 300 years. Firstly, I can guarantee the preservation of the daimyo system. I'll have to tell you this sooner or later anyway, so I may as well reveal this to you now: the future ruler of the Nipponese Underworld will be Oda Nobunaga, so he'll definitely stand up for the rights of the daimyos.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The room fell silent yet again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, it was clear that this statement had had an impact on the four underworld emissaries.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their differences from back in the mortal realm had already been set aside after their deaths. Not many people still held onto their grudges from their living days even after their deaths. Instead, most of them chose to band together as they were from the same era. Thus, having Oda Nobunaga in power would be far better than being ruled over by Izanami.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Also, your statuses and fiefs will not be changed, whereas the system of demons and gods will be completely eradicated.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The native death gods couldn't be allowed to continue to exist once a nation was conquered!</span></p>"

After several months, 300,000 new troops had been conscripted, and that was quite a staggering number, considering the Cathayan Underworld currently only had fewer than 400 million netherworldly citizens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside his office, Qin Ye was reading through a report. Three months had already passed by since the Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference, and everything was progressing as planned.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin was seated beside him, delivering a verbal report. \"... Zhou Gongjing is currently overseeing the comprehensive renovation of the Hanyang Underworld. At the moment, 12 ports have been added, and the construction projects are expected to be completed sometime in the middle of next year.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. Qin Changxin was even more invested in the invasion of the Nipponese Underworld than Qin Ye himself, and he was making an effort to be actively involved in everything. In fact, he had even developed a thorough understanding of the ships and ports that had previously been unfamiliar to him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the door of the room was opened, and Wang Chenghao quickly strode into the room with a messenger bird perched on his arm. \"Your Excellency, we've received a message from the Nipponese Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye and Qin Changxin immediately looked up upon hearing this, and with a wave of his hand, the messenger bird flew onto Qin Ye's shoulder. After hearing the message carried by the messenger bird, Qin Ye turned to Qin Changxin and said, \"It's a message from the three kampakus.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin didn't say anything, but his hands were gripping the armrests of his chair tightly, and his gaze was locked firmly on Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They agreed.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A hint of visible relief appeared in Qin Changxin's eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With another wave of Qin Ye's hand, the messenger bird disintegrated into Yin energy, and a bloodthirsty smile appeared on his face as he said, \"They agreed to use four tenshu pavilions as outposts, and those tenshu pavilions are located in Yamagata, Kochi, Nagasaki, and Aomori.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So they're creating a line of outposts throughout the Nipponese Underworld,\" Qin Changxin mused. \"Those four locations form a line through the easternmost part of the Nipponese Underworld to its westernmost part, and they're the easiest places for us to conquer. I'm assuming they didn't choose Kanto or Chubu as that's where the strongholds of the demons and gods are located. Takamagahara and Yomotsu Hirasaka are both situated there, so infiltration would be impossible for them.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"Once the war begins, they'll deploy their troops to seize control over the important cities in several provinces right as our troops arrive in the Nipponese Underworld. However, we have to reinforce them as soon as possible. They are all going to be in different areas, and the local yokai will immediately retaliate.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What are their conditions?\" Qin Changxin asked with a contemplative expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"They want fiefdoms,\" Qin Ye replied as he gently tapped the table. \"Ultimately, they don't like that the entire nation is open and connected. They prefer the past arrangement, where all of them had their own fiefdoms, in which they could control the taxation, population, and economy. On top of that, they're certainly not asking for small fiefdoms. Each of them is not only asking for the fiefdoms that they once had, they also want the several surrounding cities and counties.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He turned to Qin Changxin with a hint of a smile on his face. \"What do you plan to do?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Agree to their conditions,\" Qin Changxin replied without any hesitation. \"Prior to the commencement of the war, everything is negotiable. As for after that, there will always be solutions.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first foothold had already been established.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami hadn't caught onto Qin Ye's intentions at all during the Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference. All that was required now was to complete the development of the second-generation forbidden arts and launching technology, as well as to wait until the Mitsubishi Corporation developed its submarines. After that, they would be able to immediately contact the three great yokai of the mortal realm to initiate the plan.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This day has finally come...\" Qin Ye stood up and made his way over to the window, then cast his gaze toward the north. \"I'm eagerly awaiting the day we can finally set this plan into motion...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Four years passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The world was like the sea. There would occasionally be a tsunami here and there, but the sea was still the sea, and it wouldn't be destroyed by a tsunami or a storm. It was still operating as normal, and all of the underworlds were like the major oceans, segregating the sea that was the world into sections.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy, year 30 of the third coming of Hell, Director Qin of the Cathayan Underworld held an official press conference to implement the \"Asia-Pacific Energy Resource Collaboration Act\", officially doing away with the energy resource trade barriers in the Asia-Pacific.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy, year 32 of the third coming of Hell, the director of the ministry of energy resources formed a collaborative relationship with the Argosian Underworld. The Cathayan Underworld and the seven members of the Argosian Underworld's round table implemented the global energy resource collaboration plan, abolishing all international energy resource collaboration barriers, sending the entire world into a frenzy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy, year 33 of the third coming of Hell, Yanluo Qin lowered the cost of the energy resource once again during the Six Eyes Conference. The electricity-like energy string's price was set at 0.5 dragon jade per unit, and during November of that year, the Argosian Underworld made a public international announcement, declaring that the first obstacle to the development of electricity-like energy string substitutes and electricity-like Yin energy waves had been overcome.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the end of the same year, the Cathayan Underworld also made a public international announcement, officially declaring a second-generation energy resource known as the Hyper Joule Separation Rune. As a result, the entire underworld underwent another energy resource revolution.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a good beginning. Back when the new energy resource was first developed, there were many lucky coincidences involved, and in reality, the research and development capabilities of the Cathayan Underworld were still far from being able to match those of the Argosian Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, with the release of the new energy resource and the anchoring of the dragon jade, large sums of revenue began to flow into the Cathayan Underworld, giving it more and more influence on the world stage, to the point that it was approaching its status back when the second King Yanluo was in power.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These funds were then immediately invested into the education sector and all types of infrastructure construction, and a series of roads were laid, connecting Everburn to all parts of the nation. Railway tracks were also built, and the Yin soldiers of Hell swept through all of the uninhabited areas, driving out all of the Yin beasts there before constructing a series of bridges.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld had been developing the second-generation energy resource virtually at the same time as the Argosian Underworld, yet the gap between the two had only been a few months. This was a clear indication that the Yin runologists of the Cathayan Underworld had truly risen up in the wake of the new energy resource boom.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy, year 34 of the third coming of Hell, the Russian Underworld proposed the abolition of the International Military Collaboration Conference, stating that in times of peace, the conference was all but redundant. However, the proposal was unanimously turned down by the four pillars, citing the threat that had previously appeared in space as the reason for the rejection.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In August of the same year, Yamaraja of the Hindustani Underworld sent a secret message to Yanluo Qin, stating an intention to bolster the forces at the world's gate. A total of 50,000 elite troops from the Cathayan Underworld and the Hindustani Underworld were deployed in the name of patrolling the sea, only to mysteriously disappear without a trace. All of the underworlds expressed unease toward this, wanting to know whether the two armies had gone, but to their surprise, the Argosian Underworld and the Aegyptian Underworld completely turned a blind eye to this, and the issue was eventually laid to rest with no resolution.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In November of the same year, the Aegyptian Underworld and the Hindustani Underworld simultaneously announced that they were going to be tackling the issues surrounding the transmission power of the Hyper Joule Separation Rune.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy, year 34 of the third coming of Hell, the Cathayan Underworld expanded its army even further to 1.3 million.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an extremely high percentage relative to the overall population, considering the Cathayan army in the mortal realm encompassed a total of fewer than three million troops despite boasting a population well in excess of a billion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everything was progressing as planned, and something seemed to be brewing beneath the calm surface.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even in the Cathayan Underworld, the weather was very warm and pleasant in April, dispelling a lot of the eerie coldness that was normally present.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">North Yin Pavilion, Everburn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everburn had become even more grand and majestic, and at this point, it was even more of a spectacle than the Forbidden City of the mortal realm. As more and more people began to work in the North Yin Pavilion, it was expanded over and over again, to the point that it now consisted of a main building that was over 100 meters tall, coupled with seven branch buildings. There were over 30 departments in total, and it had become a massive cluster of buildings that took up an enormous area.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to the red walls on the outside and the golden roofs on the inside that stretched as far as the eye could see and gleamed with golden radiance under the light of the setting sun, it bore a strong resemblance to the <span style=\"; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">Forbidden City</span>, and it was sometimes jokingly referred to as just that by the netherworldly citizens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This day was no different from any other day.

He knew just how long Hell had been waiting for this piece of news.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had already been six and a half years since the planned invasion of the Nipponese Underworld was first announced, and it was not much of an exaggeration to say that all of the higher-ups of Hell had been constantly waiting for this piece of news during that time. The fact that Qin Ye could maintain such calmness and composure upon hearing that a message had come from the Sword Coral Research Institute was a clear indication of just how much he had grown.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His calmness naturally rubbed off on those around him, and Secretary Jiang also quickly calmed down as he smiled and reported, \"Congratulations, Yanluo Qin, the Sword Coral Research Institute's space exploration plan has made an important breakthrough. The Jade Rabbit super altitude shuttle has already passed through the Array of the Nine Gods and has officially reached super attitudes!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the sky of the entire underworld was Limbo, and only Yama-Kings could directly fly into Limbo. As for this super altitude, that described the chaotic region between the sky and Limbo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin energy there was extremely chaotic, thereby making for exceptionally violent and destructive Yin energy storms. At the moment, the underworld already had some short-distance flying Yin beasts, and some flight paths had been mapped out for them, but none of those flying Yin beasts were capable of reaching super attitudes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unless one was at the Yama-King level, it was virtually impossible to withstand the fierce Yin wind formed by the violent Yin energy there. Space exploration technology in the underworld was still far away from reaching a level where satellite launches were possible. After all, it had only been less than a decade since the new energy resource had been released, and all of the underworlds were busy developing all types of electronic necessities, so very few underworlds had the spare capacity to focus on this area.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the Cathayan Underworld had succeeded!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a deep breath before asking, \"What's the maximum flight duration?

A few more seconds later, he raised his head with a serious expression and said, \"Get the minister of defense, the director of uniformed services, and all of the Yama-Kings and Abyssal Prefects to gather at Everburn this afternoon.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Secretary Jiang and Wang Chenghao quickly pulled out their notepads before writing down Qin Ye's instructions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never had they felt so full of vigor, and the tips of their pens were creating sparks as they flew over the surface of the paper.

Only after a long while did he manage to suppress his excitement as he sighed, \"Thank the heavens.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Go on.\" Qin Ye waved a dismissive hand with a smile, and the two of them immediately left the room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">…………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Gurbantünggüt Desert.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were no cities here, only some scattered villages. However, this afternoon, around a dozen Yin beasts were spotted flying over this extremely sparsely populated region, and each of them was carrying all types of different equipment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Soon, a sandstorm was swept up as rows of Yin beasts with Yin soldiers standing on their backs stormed into the desert, and the weapons of all of the Yin soldiers were gleaming under the sun.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Is something about to happen?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some of the curious netherworldly citizens decided to go and take a look, but countless Yin soldiers were already standing on the outskirts of the desert, forming an impenetrable circle to prohibit all netherworldly citizens from entry.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the center of the desert, the atmosphere was already tense to the extreme.

A claymore was strapped to its back with several chains.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only half of the claymore was exposed, but there were countless complex Yin runes on just the visible part of the claymore alone. Virtually all of these Yin runes were within or beyond the ninth circle, and it was impossible to make out anything clearly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yin runes were glowing like stars, making it appear as if the sword were forged from celestial bodies, and bursts of faint shockwaves were spreading from the hilt of the sword every single second, as if it were unable to contain the power that it held, but was still somehow able to maintain a peculiar balance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The surrounding sand proliferated outward alongside the invisible shockwaves, making it appear as if the mechanical cow were a living creature that was breathing rhythmically.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How are the figures looking?\" Lu Ban was frantically traversing through a group of underworld emissaries like a madman.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The device is in a perfect state of homeostasis without any Yin rune fluctuations being generated.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What about the resonance figures?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There's been no change.

They had to be activated using Yin energy, and only Yama-King level Yin energy would suffice. If a mishap were to occur during the explosion, even Yama-Kings would be destroyed, and everyone else here would most likely perish as well!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In order to ensure absolute stability, astronomical sums of money had been invested into the construction of every single inch of the claymore!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the time of detonation drew closer and closer, Lu Ban became more and more anxious. Just as he was pacing from side to side, Zhao Yun finally smiled and said, \"There's no need to be so agitated, President Lu. These figures have already been tested countless times, and even if something goes wrong during the explosion, there's no way it could produce more power than the chain reaction triggered that destroyed the old Hell. Yanluo Qin will be bringing King Yanluo's Seal here, and no matter how powerful the second-generation forbidden art is, there's no way it can break through the defenses of King Yanluo's Seal, so you can rest assured.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lu Ban finally stopped in his tracks before heaving a faint sigh. \"I understand all of that, but how can I calm down at a time like this? We can't jump to these conclusions until the actual figures come out.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, gusts of Yin wind swept forth, and in the blink of an eye, Qin Ye and all of the high-ranking officials of Hell emerged on the scene.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Across from the mechanical cow, another mechanical Yin beast that was around 20 meters in length with a 25-meter wingspan appeared on the sand dune.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a mechanical Yin beast modeled after a crane.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Its long legs were folded under its belly, and its wings were wide and sturdy. Its entire body was also riddled with complex Yin runes, making it appear as if it were a galaxy that could take flight at any time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the center of the sand dune, countless gusts of Yin wind formed a vast vortex, and Qin Ye stepped out from within the vortex before sweeping his gaze across his surroundings. \"Everyone, get ready!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun immediately pressed his palm against the ground upon hearing this, and black ripples spread through the air in all directions around him, instantly encompassing an area in excess of 100,000 square kilometers!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once the shockwaves spread to their furthest point, the power behind them was exhausted, and they rose up lazily before rapidly sweeping back toward the center. Within the span of less than a minute, a massive dome that was over 100 kilometers in size had taken shape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye then cast a fervent gaze toward Zu Chongzhi and Lu Ban. \"Is everything ready?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, no matter how concerned and nervous the two of them were, they knew that they couldn't back down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lu Ban stepped forward as he said, \"There's only one question now: who's going to swing the sword?\"</span></p>"

Thankfully, Qin Ye and Arthis still had some shred of self-awareness and were communicating through voice transmission that only Yama-Kings could hear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Looks like they do have a sense of shame after all!

His Yin energy injection is different from that of a normal Yama-King, and the second-generation forbidden art was designed to be activated by Yama-Kings, not beings above that level. Excessively powerful injections of Yin energy could cause it to be detonated earlier than expected, so it was decided from the very beginning that Brother Yun wouldn't be able to do this.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There's still the Harken, isn't there?\" Qin Ye reflexively countered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I don't have hands,\" the Harken said in a cold voice before jumping onto his shoulder.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arthis continued, \"Given how precious you are to our Cathayan Underworld, if you tried to swing the sword, all of the researchers would immediately stand in front of you to stop you with their lives!

The Harken raised one of its paws, and a series of massive light screens appeared in front of all of the Yin soldiers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The screens depicted Arthis standing alone in the desert.

Countless Yin soldiers were staring intently at the screens, trying to commit this historic scene into their memories, not even daring to breathe as they waited for this monumental detonation to take place.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin was also among them, and he was more invested in this than anyone.

Even Qin Ye's expression changed slightly upon seeing this. Even as a Yama-King, he could sense power far beyond his own contained within the claymore.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, Arthis grabbed onto the hilt of the sword.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sword was enormous, even taller than her, but it somehow seemed to belong in her hand.

As soon as the crane flew up into the Yin clouds overhead, they immediately formed a vast vortex that was rumbling and twisting incessantly, giving off vast and unpredictable power. Beams of crimson light were flashing within the vortex, giving it a sinister appearance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lu Ban was so anxious that all of the hair on his head was standing up on end, and he frantically yelled, \"All groups report to me!

The Yin soldiers and underworld emissaries outside of the central sphere of power were perhaps only treating this as a visual spectacle, but the truly high-ranking officials knew just how significant the second-generation forbidden art was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After what seemed like an eternity, all sound faded from the world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the deathly silence, a figure pierced through the heavens like lightning in a storm before descending from above.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her clothes and purple hair were flapping incessantly, and she was like a deity that had descended from heaven. Right as she began her descent, she slashed the dazzling sword in her hand through the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">BOOM!!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A violent boom rang out across the entire desert, and sand erupted upward for over 100 meters before falling like rain. Heaven and earth were illuminated by dazzling white radiance, following which nothing else could be seen.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the underworld emissaries closed their eyes, and for an instant, they lost their sense of hearing as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the Yama-Kings had closed their eyes.

The pillar of clouds extended right up into the heavens, undergoing nine violent explosions in an extremely short time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Each level of the sea of clouds was a shockwave, and they progressed from large to small from the bottom to the top. The bottom level was filled with boundless sand and inky-black Yin energy that resembled a sea of black flower petals.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless souls were howling and screaming within it, and this applied to every other level as well. It was as if this were a massive pillar formed by Yin spirits, culminating into a dazzling sun at the very top.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a crimson sun that stood like a ruby above the 18 abysses of punishment. The sun was tens of thousands of meters in size, and even the actual sun paled in the face of its radiance. All of the Yin clouds were scattered, and a gigantic hole had been forcibly torn into the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">None of the Yin spirits uttered even a single word.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were all proud of this moment, but also astonished by the marvelous spectacle they were witnessing, shocked by the power of underworld technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone was also completely still.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were all entirely enraptured by this scene, and it seemed that they had been robbed of the ability to think and move.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a full 30 minutes had passed did everything begin to slowly dim, and the Yin clouds on the ground gradually faded, but the entire desert within an area of over 100,000 square kilometers had been reduced to countless shattered glass shards!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The glass shards were in all types of different colors, and they were buried within the sand of the desert, presenting an incredible spectacle to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Upon being exposed to high temperatures, sand would sometimes turn into glass, and that was what had happened here. Not only did the second-generation forbidden art possess terrifying destructive power, it was also capable of giving off incredible heat!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Where's Arthis?\" Qin Ye was the first one to return to his senses.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm over here.\" Arthis's voice rang out from behind him, and Qin Ye turned around to look for her, upon which his pupils immediately contracted drastically.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arthis was in an extremely sorry state. Her clothes were in tatters, and large sections of her hair had been charred, even though she had been several thousand meters above the ground earlier!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lu Ban and the scientists were quickly tallying up the figures, but Qin Ye paid no heed to that. In contrast with a bunch of statistics and figures that he couldn't understand, he was much more interested in hearing the first-hand experience of another Yama-King in the face of the second-generation forbidden art.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How did it feel?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arthis took a deep breath before replying in a grim voice, \"It was terrifying... I've never experienced something so terrifying before. It's very difficult to describe. For beings below the Yama-King level, they most likely wouldn't even be able to work up the urge to run away. It's like... a demon that robs you of your autonomy.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She paused for a moment to collect her thoughts, then continued, \"The second-generation forbidden art presents two waves of destruction, the first of which comes from the extremely high temperatures and destructive force generated by the countless advanced Yin runes, and that's capable of instantly destroying everything within range. After that comes the spiritual impact. All Yin spirits at or below the Prefect-level will have their souls completely destroyed if they're within range.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Can a Yama-King directly withstand it?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Absolutely not!\" Arthis immediately replied without any hesitation. \"If I had gotten away any later than I did, I most likely wouldn't be standing here right now. There's no way that a Yama-King would be able to withstand the power of the second-generation forbidden art. Perhaps only beings above the Yama-King level would be capable of that...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as her voice trailed off, a string of alarmed cries rang out from behind them, followed by a clear crack.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye faltered slightly upon hearing this, then swung around to find that a massive crack had appeared on the protective barrier erected by Zhao Yun!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as the crack appeared, it began to rapidly elongate, and bursts of crimson radiance quickly surged in through the crack. Qin Ye's mind went completely blank for a moment before he hurriedly yelled, \"Look out!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even a being above the Yama-King level couldn't withstand this power!</span></p>"

Immediately thereafter, Qin Ye, the Harken, and Arthis did the same thing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Massive quantities of Yin energy were injected into the protective barrier, but it was still too little, too late. Qin Ye's pupils contracted drastically as he yelled, \"What are you waiting for?! Run!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The destructive power of the second-generation forbidden art was so great that even a being above the Yama-King level couldn't withstand it, and this was completely outside of their expectations.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lu Ban and the others shuddered slightly upon hearing this, and only then did they return to their senses before frantically fleeing the scene. They knew that they were only posing hindrances here. If the Yama-Kings didn't have to withstand the power of the explosion to protect everyone else, they would've been the first ones to escape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, all of the Yin soldiers around the protective barrier retreated in a frenzy. Meanwhile, Qin Ye and the Yama-Kings were reinforcing the protective barrier with all their might, and their arms were cracking incessantly from the strain. Qin Ye's teeth were gritted tightly as he said, \"What happened, General Zhao?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I was too careless.\" Zhao Yun's teeth were also gritted tightly, and his cape was burning with scorching netherfire. \"This protective barrier is able to withstand 30 times the power of a first-generation forbidden art. According to the estimates of the Yin Mountains Research Institute, the second-generation forbidden art should be somewhere within 10 times to 20 times more powerful than first-generation forbidden arts. At the moment, this is already the most powerful defensive barrier I'm capable of creating...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"><em>Damn it...&nbsp;</em></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Sweat was pouring down Qin Ye's face from exertion, and right at this moment, the Harken yelled, \"Get out of here!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Ye had a chance to reply, it continued, \"All of us are expendable, but no harm can be allowed to befall you! Even if we're injured, we can recover behind the scenes, but no one can take your place!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Go!\" Arthis also urged with a grim expression. \"Hurry!

After that, he closed his eyes and let the heavens decide his fate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire world seemed to have been robbed of sound, but it was trembling violently as if an earthquake had struck. After what felt like an eternity, Qin Ye slowly opened his eyes, and his first reaction was to inspect his own internal condition.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Much to his surprise, he was completely fine!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, he could see that Zhao Yun, Arthis, and the Harken were all standing in their original spots, relatively unscathed, while an enormous black hole that was over 100,000 meters in size had appeared at the center of the desert.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I'm... fine?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slowly rose to his feet, and even now, his heart was still thumping like a jackhammer. He raised his own hand and took a look to confirm that he was indeed safe and sound. Only then did he notice that his entire body was already drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you alright?\" he asked in an extremely hoarse voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three Yama-King's nodded in unison, but for some reason, they didn't say anything, and he couldn't see their expressions as they had their backs facing him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What happened just now?

Qin Ye looked up in the same direction, then finally heaved a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A figure had appeared up above.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a well-built figure with a head of short hair, wearing a set of simple camouflage attire and combat boots.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is that the second King Yanluo?\" All of the unease in Qin Ye's heart instantly faded. \"He came right in the nick of time...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the moment, a black ball was rapidly shrinking within the second King Yanluo's palm, and finally, he crushed it into nothingness between his two hands. He then descended onto the ground before turning to Qin Ye with an impressed expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Not bad at all.\" Several seconds later, he began to applaud with a smile. \"I didn't think that you would be able to restore the record of the Demonic Oven's explosion.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What's that?\" Qin Ye made his way over to the second King Yanluo. He was already over 180 centimeters tall, but he was still significantly shorter than the second King Yanluo, and that was very displeasing to him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How the hell did you get so tall?

However, due to certain reasons, it once exploded, and you've just managed to replicate the explosion from back then. Of course, this explosion is only a tiny fraction of the power of the actual explosion. When a true divine artifact explodes, only a true deity would be able to survive, and I was fortunate enough to have witnessed that. However, it's far too difficult to completely replicate the circumstances that led to the explosion. I could only guess the most fundamental factors, and in my spare time, I recorded it out of boredom...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Hold on, you're saying this isn't the second-generation forbidden art startup module that you left behind?\" Qin Ye asked with a stony expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo faltered slightly upon hearing this, following which his mouth gaped wide open, but he quickly put on a composed expression as he replied, \"That was uh... indeed my thought process back then... So I created that into... whatever startup module...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">You're not fooling anyone!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye had to hold back the urge to slap him across the face.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"><em>Why hadn't he told everyone in advance that this was replicating the power of an explosion of a divine artifact as large as a planet?! Things were on the verge of descending into disaster just now!</em></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No wonder the researchers and Zhao Yun had all misevaluated its power, there was no way that anyone could've calculated this!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of Qin Ye's cold gaze, the second King Yanluo was feeling quite awkward, and he cleared his throat before using his \"that's not the point!\" diversion technique.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on Qin Ye's face. It had been a long time since he had seen anyone use that diversion technique. As Arthis, Wang Chenghao, and himself had climbed up higher and higher through the ranks, they had done away with such shameless tactics, but it appeared that the second King Yanluo still hadn't received the memo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo continued with a serious expression, \"The point is that your restoration has been completed far sooner than I expected. If I had taken on this project myself, it would've most likely taken me 50 to 60 years to reach the same stage. Hence, on behalf of the world's gate, I would like to order 12 second-generation forbidden arts from you!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"On behalf of the world's gate? Can you even represent them?\" Qin Ye countered. \"Has everyone else agreed? You're not getting anything out of me unless you pay up?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, a scroll was tossed into his hands, and he spread it open to take a look, upon which his expression immediately changed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a massive list of A-grade and S-grade materials, as well as S-grade war fortresses, mechanical beasts, and siege weapons!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye closed the scroll as a warm smile appeared on his face. \"Should we take a walk together?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhao Yun and the others could clearly see that they wanted to discuss something alone, so they quickly departed. It was already nighttime, and the sky was filled with countless stars. Qin Ye and the second King Yanluo slowly walked along the desert, enjoying the unique scenery of the desert in the night.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After walking quietly for a few minutes, Qin Ye suddenly asked, \"Will this cause radiation to the area?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No,\" the second King Yanluo replied. \"You can't even begin to imagine what the original explosion was like. It doesn't require any radiation, just the power of the explosion alone was enough to kill all beings that weren't true gods.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to continue, the second King Yanluo asked, \"What do you plan to name it?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was silent for a long while before replying, \"Seeing as this is replicating the explosion of the Demon's Oven, I wanted to call it Demon, but demons don't exist in the Cathayan Underworld, so it should be named Death God.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a simple name, yet it entailed pure death.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo nodded in response. He was useless at naming things, so he didn't find this to be a bad idea. Qin Ye continued, \"Is the situation in the world's gate that bad?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He stopped in his tracks as he looked into the second King Yanluo's eyes, then said, \"Even now, I'm unable to fathom exactly how powerful you are, and even the Heavenly Dao seems to fear you to a certain extent. The entire world is like a game to you. You come and go as you please without any fears or worries. How is there something in the world's gate that even you're unable to take care of?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo looked back at him, and only after a long silence did he reply, \"It's not as simple as you think.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He paused for another minute before casually kicking up some sand as he continued, \"I never planned to step in. You want to know why? It's very simple. All of you think that you're gods, death gods, but you don't know how big this universe is and how terrifying true gods are. They are on the other side of the universe, watching everything developing, witnessing the rise and fall of one civilization and planet after another. They are far colder and more aloof than the Heavenly Dao. In contrast with them, the Heavenly Dao is as pure as a three-year-old infant. For any civilization, once it branches out into space, it will be a new beginning. They will have emerged from their comfort zone and stepped onto the battlefield between realms. If they succeed, then they'll encounter countless civilizations that they had never thought existed. There are demons, elves, insects, all types of strange things. If the underworld can't break these shackles, then it doesn't deserve to take that step. At the very most, I can only ensure that Earth won't be destroyed. This is my home, after all, and I'll help where I can, but I definitely won't do everything and lure all of you into a false sense of security. You may be standing at the pinnacle of the underworld, but in the face of the most powerful civilizations in space, you're nothing. On top of that, I'm not your nanny. Why should I risk my life for your sake? If I were to do that, other gods would do the same, and that's strictly prohibited.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're a god?\" Qin Ye asked with a stunned expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Indeed, a true god!\" the second King Yanluo replied as he puffed out his chest.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye hesitated for a long time before asking a suicidal question. \"Are you insane?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I can kill you with a single punch, you know that?\" The second King Yanluo glared at him before vanishing on the spot. \"In 10 years, we'll complete the trade!\"</span></p>"

Coupled with the second-generation forbidden arts, it'll be enough to take down the Nipponese Underworld!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What about our equipment?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We have the most advanced equipment in the world.\" It was Zhao Yun who replied this time, and he made his way over to Qin Ye before extending a slight bow. \"The first decade of the past 30 years of our Cathayan Underworld's development was focused on infrastructure construction and research and development. In the 10 years after that, we focused on education, and ever since you decided to attack the Nipponese Underworld, there have been marked improvements in the military sector.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Most importantly, our Cathayan Underworld and the Hanyang Underworld are extremely well-connected, as are all of the regions within the Cathayan Underworld,\" Arthis also chimed in. \"Thus, we can mobilize our forces extremely quickly, definitely far quicker than the Nipponese Underworld will be able to.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response, then turned and cast his gaze toward the boundless desert.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This place couldn't even be called a desert anymore. Instead, it was like a land of mirrors! If moon landings became possible in the underworld someday, then this place would definitely become an internationally renowned landmark, much like the Sahara desert or the Great Wall in the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Glass shards of all types of different colors were littered all over the ground, looking as if they were uneven crystalline pillars. If one wasn't aware of how they had been formed, they would most likely be stunned by how incredible nature could be.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, for all those who did know of the origins of this place, this sight would only evoke memories of lingering fear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a piece of history.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The resurgence of the Cathayan Underworld was going to begin from this desert!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even Qin Ye himself was struck by a sense of surrealism as he stood here. This was a desert of glass that would only appear in movies, and it was truly an awe-inspiring sight. He couldn't help but wonder whether the second-generation forbidden art would cause more destruction to the Nipponese Underworld than the nuclear bombs had inflicted upon Nippon in the mortal realm back in the second world war.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I have to make a trip,\" he suddenly said.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before anyone else had a chance to reply, he turned around with a serious expression and continued, \"Now that everything has been prepared, all we need to do is recruit the help of the three great yokai of the mortal realm, and we'll be able to immediately deploy our troops to the Hanyang Underworld.

The number of people who committed suicide here was second only to the Golden Gate Bridge of Usonia, which was quite ironic, considering that this place was a forest that seemed to be teeming with life.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The species of trees here were quite uniform, so it was impossible to decipher where one was unless they had a vast wealth of experience in survival in the wild. Due to the abundance of iron ore and volcanic magma here, the magnetic fields prevented compasses from working properly. Regardless of whether one intended to commit suicide, once they entered this place, it was virtually impossible to get out again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were countless legends associated with this forest, and one could spot corpses hanging by rope from trees virtually once every several hundred meters. It was said that the residents living nearby could hear the rustling of rope every night, and there were even claims that people had seen a hung ghost with a tongue that was over a meter in length roaming through the forest.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"In the past, most of the nearby residents were quite impoverished.\" An elderly man was walking along a country road while supporting himself with a cane, and he was panting slightly as he said, \"Unfortunately, they had to leave abandoned infants and many elderly people in the forest to starve to death, and that was how Aokigahara came into existence. Everyone knows that the better living standards become, the more people come to commit suicide here. You haven't come here to commit suicide, have you, young man?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was walking along behind the elderly man in a crisp suit while inspecting the village with an intrigued expression, and he casually replied, \"No.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The aura of resentment hanging over the forest was extremely dense, so much so that it was clearly visible to him. The entire forest was encompassed under a vast expanse of gray mist, within which there were countless howling souls.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the people who had entered this place were at the height of despair, and they carried immense resentment toward the world. Over the past centuries, this place had already become a paradise for evil ghosts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What was a little troublesome was that the evil ghosts had already fused as one with the surrounding trees and even formed an array. This was a completely naturally forming array, and it would not be easy to dispel it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't that he couldn't dispel it, the problem was that doing so carelessly would cause quite a commotion, one that could perhaps even be noticed by the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Good. There's no shortage of tourists who come here every year. It's a good thing that you reserved a room with me in advance. If you had contacted me a week or two later than you did, I may not have had any vacancies.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded casually in response, then continued to inspect his surroundings. It had to be said that the scenery was very unique here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was no different from the average Nipponese village, but there were many signs littered throughout the village with large red text written on them, bearing messages such as \"Life is something to be cherished!\", \"Please think about your family!\", \"There's always hope in life, so don't give up!\", etc.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The elderly man turned around to discover Qin Ye looking at the signs, and a wry smile appeared on his face. \"Those signs don't really do much. When you see a person who's determined to end their own life here, they are extremely calm and stable, so it's impossible to tell who's here for tourism and who's here to commit suicide. These signs aren't anywhere near enough to shake their resolve. Ah, we're here, please come in.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The elderly man's room wasn't very large. It was an ordinary Nipponse-style wooden cabin, and it seemed to be quite old, but it was very clean and tidy. The elderly man led Qin Ye into the room with a smile, then put on his slippers, and right as he was going to pour some tea, Qin Ye's voice suddenly rang out from behind him. \"Have you heard of the shimenawa of Aokigahara?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The elderly man turned around to face Qin Ye with a wary expression, and only after a long while did he ask, \"Who are you?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye calmly put on a pair of slippers himself, then said, \"Yamada Shintaro, also known as Master Yokoromo. You were banished from Enryakuji of Ōtsu 20 years ago and came to Aokigahara to commit suicide, but you encountered Iwasaki Kyōya, who was on holiday at the time, and he convinced you to live on and join the Mitsubishi Corporation. There's no need to be so tense and anxious, it was Mr. Iwasaki himself who told me to come here. I'm sure he already gave you a call several years ago. I was delayed by some matters, so I'm a few years late. Mr. Iwasaki has already passed away. If you need confirmation, you can call Iwasaki Ichiro. Tell him that my surname is Qin, and that we met several years ago in Takeshigerō. I'm sure he still remembers me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Master Yokomoro stared at Qin Ye for a moment longer before extending a slight bow. \"Please pardon me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He quickly made his way into the inner room, and several minutes later, he emerged with a smile before extending a deep bow. \"It is an honor for me to be visited by you in person, Mr. Qin. Iwasaki-san has asked me to pass on his greetings to you, and he also wanted to know if you require any assistance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's alright.\" Qin Ye sat down onto the sofa and said, \"All I need is some information, and I'll be leaving soon.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't know what Iwasaki Ichiro had said to Master Yokoromo, but he was acting in an extremely respectful fashion. He poured a cup of tea for Qin Ye, then offered it up to him with both hands, and only then did a serious look appear on his face as he said, \"I recall that you asked about a legend earlier. So many people have died in Aokigahara, yet there haven't been any evil ghosts wreaking havoc, and that's because of the Nipponese Underworld's intervention. There are underworld emissaries sent to patrol the forest each year, and they appear in the deepest part of the forest. There is a shimenawa there, and those who step over the rope will arrive in the world of the dead.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a small sip of the tea to find that it was slightly bitter, but had a very vibrant green color.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At some point in history, tea in Cathay and Nippon diverged in two different directions. In the past, tea leaves were steamed in Cathay, but during the Song and Ming Dynasties, roasting became the preferred method of treatment for tea leaves. During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, tea spread to Nippon, but they had always maintained the tradition of steaming their tea leaves.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Roasted tea was far more fragrant than steamed tea, while steamed tea was more vibrant in color, but also more bitter. The so-called matcha was essentially steamed green tea leaves ground into powder.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye wasn't a fan of this type of tea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So is there one or not?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There is,\" Master Yokoromo replied with a serious expression. \"My master told me that there's a yokai lurking in Aokigahara, and it's been there since the reign of Emperor Jimmu! It collects the hair of all of the people who've died in the forest and uses their souls and their hair to weave its shimenawa, which is the only black shimenawa in existence! My master says that there are two massive ancient trees in Aokigahara, but they can't be seen from the outside. Only by taking a specific route and using a specific method will one be able to see the other world. Each of the trees is over 100 meters tall, and between the two trees is the black shimenawa.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How do I get in there?\" Qin Ye asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Master Yokoromo carefully pulled an item out of his pocket before offering it up to Qin Ye with both hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a white finger bone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It looked as if it had been made of jade, and it was very smooth to the touch. As soon as Qin Ye accepted the bone, he discovered that it was pointed in a certain direction, and it refused to point in any other direction even as he applied force to it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is a bone that belonged to a renowned Buddhist master,\" Master Yokoromo said as he brought his palms together. \"It will guide you in the right direction in Aokigahara.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response before stowing the bone away. \"Anything else?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Master Yokoromo shook his head in response, and Qin Ye instantly vanished into a burst of Yin energy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Master Yokoromo was so startled by this that he dropped his teacup onto the ground, and he abruptly stood up as if he had been electrocuted, while cold sweat poured down his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What happened?!

After flying in that direction for 10 minutes, a rock face appeared before him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had arrived at the foot of Mount Fuji, and there were mountain ranges of different sizes everywhere here. However, this mountain range was a little different.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the eyes of normal humans, this was just another mountain face, and the only minute difference was that there seemed to be slightly fewer trees nearby. However, from Qin Ye's perspective, he could see a hole in the mountain face that had clearly been drilled through artificial means!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hole was very large, roughly 10 meters in diameter, and there was a pair of skeletons wearing onmyouji attire standing at its entrance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wisps of Yin energy were seeping out of the hole, and the finger bone was also pointed directly at it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Interesting...&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face as he slowly made his way toward the mountain face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the entrance of the hole, the two skeletons were standing like statues while holding hand fans, but in this instant, both of them raised their heads in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Hmm?\" They cast a perplexed gaze toward the approaching Qin Ye, then turned to one another in a surprised manner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is he here to commit suicide and just so happened to arrive here?\" one of the skeletons asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why do I get the feeling... that he can see us?\" the other skeleton mused. \"He's been looking in this direction this entire time.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How is that possible?\" the first skeleton scoffed. \"There's no Yin energy coming from his body, and there's no way normal humans can see underworld emissaries...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before the skeleton even had a chance to finish its sentence, Qin Ye abruptly vanished on the spot, and by the time he reappeared, he was already standing right beside them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two skeletons turned toward him in a wooden manner, and they were so frightened that their teeth were chattering uncontrollably, while the netherfire in their eyes had turned bright red. Before they had a chance to say anything, Qin Ye laid his hands onto their shoulders before asking in a calm voice, \"Is Amanozako in here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two underworld emissaries nodded in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't that they didn't want to hide the truth, they were simply too terrified to do so!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as they nodded in response, they immediately realized what they had just done, and their mouths abruptly sprang open. \"Who are y...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, the two of them were reduced to a flurry of black butterflies that vanished on the spot, while Qin Ye continued onward like a gust of Yin wind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside the mountain face was a pitch-black passageway with human-skin lanterns hanging on either side, and all of the underworld emissaries in the wake of the gust of Yin wind were instantly reduced to ashes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The passageway wasn't very long, only several dozen meters in length, and Qin Ye quickly emerged on the other side, upon which he was greeted by the sight of a wilted forest.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were no wilted sections of Aokigahara on any satellite images, but one had appeared here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ground was completely covered in a thick layer of dead leaves, and as they were blown up into the air by the gusts of Yin wind, they resembled paper money for the dead. Beneath the fallen leaves were countless skeletons that had been partially devoured, and there were also countless bodies hanging from the wilted trees, swaying slightly in the wind as if they had sprung back to life.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the gust of Yin wind continued onward, a murder of crows squawked as they flew up into the air, and there was such a massive number of them that they resembled a dark cloud. This place was a tomb that had been abandoned even by the gods. There seemed to be something constantly watching Qin Ye from behind the wilted branches and dead leaves, but Qin Ye was completely unfazed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had seen far more terrifying sights than this, and his gaze was focused entirely on the center of the forest, where there were two giant trees extending up into the heavens, between which was a black shimenawa.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if all of the vitality in this part of the forest had been robbed by these two trees. The entire forest was wilted and dead, but these two trees were thriving, and their enormous canopies were casting massive shadows onto the undergrowth, giving the place an even more eerie and sinister aura.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beyond the pair of trees was an abyss of pure darkness, but Qin Ye certainly wasn't afraid of something like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on his face, and with a wave of his arm, all of the fallen leaves were sent flying like countless black and yellow butterflies. At the same time, a series of Soul Shackles flew directly toward the shimenawa like speeding arrows.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're a Yama-King?!\" An astonished voice rang out from behind the shimenawa, and in the next instant, a pair of bright golden eyes lit up within the darkness. Countless gusts of Yin wind blew out from the area between the shimenawa in a frenzy, following which an enormous creature slowly extended its head out of the darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was also at the same time that Qin Ye drew to a halt in front of the shimenawa, and countless dead leaves were falling around him as he clasped his hands behind his back. \"Are you Amanozako?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The shimenawa was around 20 meters above the ground, and within the darkness above the rope, there was a massive monster with a huge nose and sharp, hooked fangs staring intently at him with its mouth gaped wide open.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was wearing a court noble hat, and only its head, neck, and hands were revealed, as well as a small section of its scarlet clothes. It had a pair of golden eyeballs and azure skin, and the flesh on its face was bulging in a grotesque manner, while thin strands of hair were trailing down from either side of its hat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a massive monster, standing at over 10 meters in size, and its hands were instinctively placed in front of it for protection while its body was writhing in an uneasy manner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She really is hideous...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was Qin Ye's first thought.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His second thought was:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If I were Susanoo-no-Mikoto, I would definitely abandon you as well...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye repressed the disgust in his heart as he said, \"I'm sure you recognize me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amanozako was jerked out of her astonished stupor upon hearing this, and in the next instant, a deafening scream rang out across the entire forest, causing all of the trees to sway violently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're the ruler of the Cathayan Underworld!\" Unadulterated horror appeared in Amanozako's eyes as she frantically retreated into the darkness, but she wasn't as fast as Qin Ye's Soul Shackles.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of chains plunging into flesh rang out incessantly as the Soul Shackles pierced into the darkness, and Amanozako howled with agony as bursts of Yin energy erupted out of her body like fountains.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're not going anywhere!\" A cold look appeared in Qin Ye's eyes as he tugged vigorously on his Soul Shackles, and a black shadow passed over his head as a giant figure was pulled out of the darkness, then crashed down onto the ground, sending dead leaves flying in all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Amanozako.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She was wearing a scarlet kimono with the Hyakki Yagyō embroidered upon it, and her sparse hair was arranged into a knot on the back of head with several hairpins attached to it. The lower half of her body was that of a snake, and it was still concealed within the darkness, but rotten and putrid pus was flowing out from under every single one of her scales.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye suddenly felt a sense of sympathy toward her, and he heaved a faint sigh before patting her hand. \"Don't be afraid, I bear no ill will toward you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She hadn't chosen to look like this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Judging from her hair and her attire, it was clear that she strived for beauty as well, but unfortunately, she simply wasn't born with the natural gifts required.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On top of that, her father had abandoned her right after she was born, leaving her in this godforsaken place. It really was an extremely unfortunate existence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amanozako gritted her teeth as she slowly clambered up from the ground. As soon as she raised her upper body, she immediately got down into a dogeza pose. \"Amanozako welcomes Yanluo Qin of the Cathayan Underworld! May I ask how I have caused offense to you, Your Excellency? State your order and I will immediately execute it!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of leather boots crunching down onto fallen leaves rang out, and she looked up ever so slightly, just so she could see the pair of shiny shoes before her.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Raise your head.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes...\" Amanozako was extremely reluctant to follow this order. She was partially relegating herself here in order to hide from the rest of the world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even her parents had abandoned her for her looks, and she didn't want anyone else to see her, but she was forced to display her face now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, as soon as she raised her head, a surprised look immediately appeared in her eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She saw a handsome young man without any disgust or pity in his eyes, only a sense of regal majesty.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He only sees me as a lower underworld emissary, not a monster...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At times, it only took a single look to convey many things, and words weren't necessarily always required.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Neither of them said anything, but Amanozako was suddenly struck by a sense of acceptance, something that she hadn't felt for a very long time, and it was making her quite emotional.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that change in mindset, she extended a genuine bow toward Qin Ye before asking, \"What instructions do you have for me, Your Excellency?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye looked intently at her for a long while before finally asking, \"Is there hatred in your heart?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no need to ask her what or who exactly she hated. Amanozako gritted her teeth as she replied in a trembling voice, \"There is... I hate Susanoo-no-Mikoto for abandoning me! I hate Izanami for not allowing me to enter the underworld, relegating me to the mortal realm to be ridiculed! I hate those underworld emissaries! They always look at me with pity and disgust instead of the reverence afforded to gods!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"The Nipponese Underworld is only a third-rate underworld. You are already only half a step away from becoming an Abyssal Prefect, so they don't have the ability to place you into the cycle of reincarnation, just like how Yama-Kings can't be reincarnated in the Cathayan Underworld. However, we can allow Abyssal Prefects to be reincarnated.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amanozako shuddered violently upon hearing this, and her giant mouth sprang open as if she wanted to say something, but she was unable to utter even a single word.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I can allow you to be reincarnated, and you can even be the most beautiful woman in the world in your next life if you want.

This is a Heavenly Dao Contract written by Ghost King Zhao, and no one can revoke it unless they're more powerful than him.

The fact that you're here means that you have a way to enter Nippon without being detected. Seeing as Izanami still hasn't appeared, it's clear that you've managed to remain concealed to her. In other words, given my relationship with the Nipponese Underworld, it would perhaps be centuries for me to be discovered if I were to die here. In contrast, if I agree to serve you, then I still have a chance at reincarnation, while the alternative is instant death without any chance at reincarnation. I may be ugly, but I'm not stupid.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A smile appeared on Qin Ye's face. \"You're going to trust me just like that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amanozako raised her head and looked directly into his eyes as she murmured, \"My intuition is telling me that you're trustworthy.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was the first person to have regarded her without any pity or disgust, and that was an extremely precious thing to her.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"May I ask what your plans are, Your Excellency?\" Amanozako asked as she wrote her name down on the Heavenly Dao Contract.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye stowed the contract away as a cold smile appeared on his face. \"It's very simple, really.

Following behind him were several Yin spirits in high-end underworld suits, and their expressions were just as urgent and panicked as his.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, no matter how panicked they were feeling, they didn't dare to cause a commotion, and they had to nod in acknowledgment whenever they passed by any underworld emissaries.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the Formosa Provincial Courthouse, and all personnel from underworlds outside of the four pillars were considered to be inferior here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The group of Yin spirits quickly passed through several doors, and a spacious hall appeared up ahead. Yin spirits of many different ethnicities were conversing with one another at the tables in the hall, and there was a large table that was around 15 meters in length at the center of the hall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They quickly strode over to the table, and the thin Yin spirit at the forefront of the ground laid her hands flat against the table as he said with gritted teeth, \"I need to see Envoy Kawashima Takuma of the Nipponese Underworld! Now!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Yin spirit at the front desk was wearing a hanfu dress, and she checked the table in front of her before replying with a smile, \"My apologies, Mr. Saotome, but Envoy Kawashima is currently in a meeting with the administrative commissioner.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you sure it's just a meeting?!\" Mr. Saotome's voice abruptly sprang up a few octaves, attracting much attention from everyone else in the hall, and he immediately lowered his voice as he said, \"This is unlawful detention! It goes against international laws!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm sorry,\" the woman replied as she extended a slight bow. \"We'll notify you right away when the commissioner concludes his meeting with Envoy Kawashima.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Listen here!\" Saotome was on the verge of erupting. \"This is most definitely a misunderstanding, the biggest misunderstanding in the history of our two underworlds!

The Cathayan Underworld can't just keep us from seeing our nation's envoy forever!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the phone began to ring, and the female Yin spirit at the front desk picked up the receiver before listening for a few seconds, then placed her hand over the mouthpiece as she said, \"Envoy Saotome, Commissioner Zhou has just concluded his meeting with Envoy Kawashima, and Envoy Kawashima would like to see you now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Take me to him!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a rather small room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had all of the standard furniture, including a phone, and aside from the several Yin soldiers standing on lookout duty outside, it would be just like any other guest room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kawashima Takuma was seated on the sofa with his head in his hands. After just a single day, his soul had already become extremely frail. His cheeks were sunken, and the netherfire in his eyes had been reduced to the size of peas, looking as if they could be snuffed out at any moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The door swung open violently, and Saotome rushed in. Kawashima Takuma's eyes immediately lit up upon seeing him, but before he had even stood up from the sofa, he was dragged to his feet by the collar by Saotome.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Do you know what you've done?!\" Saotome's eyes were virtually spitting fire. \"Do you know how massive a crisis this is?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kawashima Takuma's lips were trembling, but he couldn't utter even a single word.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's enough!\" a female Yin spirit said in a grim voice. \"This is not the time to be discussing who's at fault. We are here to solve the problem, not vent our anger!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Saotome set Kawashima Takuma back down onto the sofa, then immediately said through gritted teeth, \"I'll ask the questions, you do the talking. Firstly, is the ship ours?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It is,\" Kawashima Takuma lowered his head in a dejected manner. \"It's a ship from the Furoku Shipbuilding Factory. Only the largest shipbuilding factories have the technology required to construct ironclad warships. According to the serial number on the rear of the ship, it was constructed over 40 years ago, and we've managed to find out both the location of production and the staff involved.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Idiot!

Rage and indignation had been building up inside him like a pressure cooker the entire day, and it finally all erupted as he roared, \"What did you want me to say?! I said that there were no Nipponese underworld emissaries, and that it was just a pile of clothes on the ship, but the commissioner didn't believe me! He says he has witnesses who saw the soldiers fighting back! After that, all of the soldiers were eradicated! Do you know what that means?! They robbed us of the chance to defend ourselves even before we arrived on the scene!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Saotome's eyelids twitched slightly, and he massaged his temples vigorously as he said, \"Take a seat. My apologies, I got too worked up.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the underworld emissaries took a seat, and a lady said, \"What about the Cathayan Underworld? What are they saying?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's the most terrifying part.\" Kawashima Takuma tried to pick up his teacup, but his hands were trembling so violently that it was as if he were spasming, and he slammed the teacup down as he said in a trembling voice, \"The Cathayan Underworld isn't saying anything! All they're doing is levying accusations one after another! Before you got here, all they did was blame the Nipponese Underworld over and over again for this situation!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Deathly silence.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not a single under world emissary said anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the Cathayan Underworld could let things slide, then this would be nothing more than a minor incident, but if they chose to pursue this matter to the end, then this really could be an indisputable excuse to start a war!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The gravity of the situation was finally beginning to dawn on everyone, and one of them asked in a trembling voice, \"They're not planning to start a war, are they?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's impossible!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There's no reason for them to do that!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Our Nipponese Underworld may be a third-rate underworld, but our defenses are top-notch! On top of that, we have a creation-grade divine artifact!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is that supposed to be a joke? You think the three pillars and the other underworlds will just watch as the Cathayan Underworld starts a war? Times have changed! We're living in a peaceful era now!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Then what exactly do they want?\" Saotome was absolutely frantic at this point. \"Are they trying to sanction us? But why? What have we done to offend them? What reason could they have for trying to start a war against us?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of the other underworld emissaries' brows were tightly furrowed as he said, \"Not only that, but they chose the daimyos as their collaborative partner for the construction of energy resource base stations, and in order to mend our relationship with the Cathayan Underworld, Mistress Izanami has let that slide. We are doing everything in our power to mend the relationship between our two nations, why would they suddenly do this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that this was the precursor for levying economic sanctions or taking military action against the Nipponese Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Were they trying to make an example out of the Nipponese Underworld to send a warning to the three pillars?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But the three pillars hadn't taken any measures that were detrimental to the Cathayan Underworld! There were many minor conflicts that took place between nations on the international stage, but there was no need to take such aggressive measures! Even an idiot would be able to tell that the Nipponese Underworld was being framed, and that was completely unbefitting of an underworld of the Cathayan Underworld's status. It was as if they just wanted to find an excuse to attack the Nipponese Underworld, but what would the other underworlds think?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wouldn't this ruin their reputation and make them seem like a warmongering nation?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What in the Nipponese Underworld could be worth that price?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the underworld emissaries fell into deep thought, and Kawashima Takuma opened his mouth to say something on several occasions, only to close it again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He really wanted to say that this incident was virtually identical to the 9.18 Incident that took place in the mortal realm several dozen years ago, and that the Cathayan Underworld was potentially considering initiating war against the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, this was such an idiotic conclusion that even he didn't dare to believe it himself, so he refrained from expressing it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, Saotome made a decision, and a pained look appeared on his face as he said, \"Get the presents, we need to pay the governor and the administrative commissioner a visit. We need to try and find out what they want and express to them that the Nipponese Underworld is willing to accept whatever is coming as long as they don't cross any boundaries.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Understood.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of newspapers were fluttering through all of the streets and alleys of the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nipponese Underworld was completely oblivious to just how much the Cathayan Underworld was hyping up the incident that they thought could easily be resolved peacefully.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Extra! Extra!\" Yellow-robed paperboys were yelling with all their might as they paced through the streets. \"Yin soldiers of the Nipponese Underworld have trespassed upon the territory of our Cathayan Underworld once again!

After taking only a quick glance, he immediately gave a cold harrumph. \"I can't believe Nippon is still this cocky even in the underworld!

Qin Ye pointed at the area between Shizuoka and Yamanashi and said, \"This is where Mount Fuji is. Mount Fuji is not far away from Tokyo, but it's not a coastal prefecture. When the time comes, I need you to transport around 200,000 Yin soldiers to the coastline as quickly as possible.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A contemplative look appeared on Amanozako's face as she said, \"Tokyo is situated at Tokyo Bay, and even though it's not as important in the underworld as it is in the mortal realm, it's still one of the Nipponese Underworld's most important cities, so it's very heavily guarded.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm asking you whether you can do it or not,\" Qin Ye said in an indifferent voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amanozako gritted her teeth before replying, \"It'll be difficult. Tokyo is part of Chubu, which is guarded in person by Izanami, as well as four powerful daimyos...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, her voice trailed off, and she raised her head to stare at Qin Ye with a stunned expression as if a thought had just occurred to her.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was proposing traveling by sea from Mount Fuji, so he would've definitely considered the possibility of being intercepted by Izanami and the daimyos. The only power in Chubu capable of opposing Izanami and the demons and gods were the daimyos, so if Qin Ye wanted to transport his troops through Chubu without being detected, the only way would be to recruit the help of the daimyos.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Did this mean that the Cathayan Underworld had already swayed the daimyos over to its side?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of complex emotions immediately welled up in her heart. When she first found out that Qin Ye was planning to invade the Nipponese Underworld, she had thought that perhaps the Nipponese Underworld would be able to put up a struggle with the help of the rest of the world. Only now did she realize just how hopeless the situation actually was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If she dared to stand up for the Nipponese Underworld, then she would be destined to be crushed along with it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, she suddenly stopped what she was saying and changed the subject in a subtle manner. \"Once you enter the Nipponese Underworld through Aokigahara's shimenawa, you'll encounter a river. I call it the Higan River, and from there, you can go directly to the Kanagawa coastline.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She stole a glance at Qin Ye as she continued, \"However, you'll have to pass through the territories of the two daimyos, Mōri Terumoto, and Kobayakawa Takakage.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"That's not an area of concern. Anything else?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I knew it! He really has recruited the daimyos already!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never had Amanozako felt the Nipponese Underworld to be in such severe peril before. She gulped nervously, then continued, \"Yue Fei's soul is situated in the Meiji Jingu of Tokyo.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A hint of elation flashed through Qin Ye's eyes upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was striking at the Nipponese Underworld not just for its geographic location and international status, but also for Yue Fei's soul!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone knew that Yue Fei's soul was in the Nipponese Underworld, and the Nipponese Underworld had never denied this, but even the daimyos didn't know where it was hidden. After all, this was Izanami's greatest secret.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I guess it makes sense that you know this, considering you're the daughter of Susanoo-no-Mikoto,\" Qin Ye said. \"Can you tell me the specific details?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes.\" Amanozako kowtowed before continuing, \"The Meiji Jingu is the largest Shinto shrine in Chubu.

Given your status, it would be very easy for you to come into contact with their representatives, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Make sure to keep in close contact with them and pay attention to the international state of affairs. Once the war begins, we won't be able to communicate through letters.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even after he vanished on the spot, Amanozako didn't dare to get up, and only after waiting for half a minute did she finally rise up from the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a conflicted look in her eyes. She didn't want to die, but nor did she detest the Nipponese Underworld as much as the daimyos did. At the end of the day, she still belonged to the faction of demons and gods.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long while, a mocking look appeared on her face as she slowly made her way back to the shimenawa. \"To think that they view themselves as so high and mighty, but in reality, they can easily be brought down by those who are truly powerful.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time passed by like flowing water, and another two years went by in a flash.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the past two years, the military equipment of the Cathayan Underworld had received another boost. With the deposit issued by the second King Yanluo, a massive batch of precious resources had appeared in the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Formosa, Nipponese Underworld Embassy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kawashima Takuma set his coffee cup lazily down onto his timber desk, then swiveled around on his chair to enjoy the sunlight pouring in through the window, letting loose a moan of pleasure as he did so.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The world was as peaceful as the surface of a still lake, and it was a fantastic time to be alive.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After working for 15 years here, he would be able to return to the cabinet. He had only secured this role after staving off countless competitors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, he had already been serving in this role for seven years, developing an extensive network during that time. Furthermore, Formosa was a very good place with mild weather, an abundance of delicious cuisines, restaurants from all different countries, and a great hospitality industry. As the world's largest first-generation energy resource transaction settlement site, this place had been transformed into a globalized city.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From his perspective, he could see countless antiquated Cathayan-style buildings that resembled undulating black waves, interspersed through which were resplendent Buddhist temples, pristine, white mosques, and extravagant churches. Anyone who visited the island would be stunned by its beauty and luxury.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the sound of door-knocking rang out, and he casually said, \"Come in...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The door was opened, and a secretary rushed into the room before immediately extending a deep bow. \"Mr. Kawashima, the Formosa municipal government is requesting us to go to the first port right away.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Alright.\" Kawashima Takuma slowly rose to his feet, then adjusted his suit before putting it on and making his way outside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't worried at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was responsible for mediating conflicts between the Cathayan Underworld and the Nipponese Underworld, but there were never any major conflicts in such peaceful times.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He got into a beast-drawn carriage, and it quickly arrived at the first port. However, as soon as he emerged from the corridor, he noticed that the situation... wasn't quite right.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a ship docked in front of the port. It was a purely metallic ship that was enormous, constructed in a style much like the warships of the Ming Dynasty. However, the flags on the ship were from the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were people of all ethnicities currently gathered on the port, locked in spirited discussion with one another, and the governor and administrative commissioner of the province of Formosa were also present.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What's going on here?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kawashima Takuma hurried over to them before extending a respectful bow. \"Governor Cao, Commissioner Zhou, we meet again.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the response he received was a cold harrumph, following which Governor Cao asked in a cold voice, \"Is this a ship from your nation, Envoy Kawashima?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kawashima Takuma took a look at it before nodding in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In reality, he didn't know whether it was or not. He had files on all of the ships that arrived at this port, and he definitely couldn't examine them one by one. However, even though he didn't know for sure, he couldn't think of any other reason why the ship would be carrying the flags of the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Good,\" Commissioner Zhou said in a cold voice. \"Nipponese soldiers in excess of 1,000 have trespassed on our territory! What is the meaning of this?! Is this a declaration of war against our Cathayan Underworld?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What?!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The calm look on Kawashima Takuma's face instantly gave way to shock. This was such an astonishing turn of events that he was temporarily at a loss for how to respond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nipponese Underworld is provoking Everburn? The Nipponese Underworld has sent soldiers to invade the Cathayan Underworld? Have they gone insane?! Why would they do that?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There must've been a mistake, Commissioner Zhou!\" Thinking back to his careless admission that this was a Nipponese ship, his soul was trembling, and he immediately said in a frantic voice, \"That's definitely impossible! Our two nations have such a strong relationship with one another, there's no way we would do something like that!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you saying that I'm in the wrong?! How dare you!\" Commissioner Zhou Kun snapped in a furious voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, he made a grabbing motion, and a light screen appeared in mid-air, depicting the deck of the metal ship, which was littered with Nipponese armor and military uniforms!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The scene was extremely chaotic, as if a battle had just taken place, and an overwhelming sense of foreboding immediately welled up in Kawashima Takuma's heart.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to say anything, Commissioner Zhou declared, \"The Nipponese Underworld's Yin soldiers have trespassed on the territory of the Cathayan Underworld, and that is equivalent to an act of war! Guards, detain him right away!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Cries of alarm rang out from all directions as all of the bystanders turned to Zhou Kun with stunned expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An act of war? From the Nipponese Underworld? How is that possible?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was also quite astonishing that they were detaining the envoy of the Nipponese Underworld based on this piece of scant evidence alone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Were they not afraid of having to bear the consequences?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Kawashima Takuma had a chance to say anything, a group of Yin soldiers rushed toward him before pinning him to the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Please have mercy! There must've been a mistake!\" Kawashima Takuma finally returned to his senses as he screamed with all his might. \"There has to have been a misunderstanding! There's no way that the Nipponese Underworld would declare war on the Cathayan Underworld!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Then how do you explain those soldiers?\" Governor Cao Gui asked with intense killing intent in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Those aren't soldiers of the Nipponese Underworld!\" Kawashima Takuma was absolutely frantic at this point. \"There's no way that's possible! The Nipponese Underworld wouldn't do something so stupid!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, a thought suddenly occurred to him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why was this scene so familiar?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the 18th of September, 1931, the Nipponese army tossed over a body, proclaiming that a Nipponese soldier had been killed by Cathayans.

They're definitely not soldiers of the Nipponese Underworld!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Ridiculous!\" Cao Gui scoffed. \"Due to the urgency of the situation, I've already eradicated all of the Nipponese troops on the ship!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, Kawashima Takuma's teeth were chattering from horror.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, it was virtually set in stone that soldiers of the Nipponese Underworld had invaded the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the soldiers had been eradicated, so the Cathayan Underworld could claim whatever it wanted!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was like the Cathayan version of the 9.18 Incident!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What are they going to do?!

We are unable to understand why the Nipponese Underworld insists on trampling over the friendship of our two nations and disrespecting the boundaries between us! If the Nipponese Underworld continues to do as it pleases without any regard for consequences, then the Cathayan Underworld will be forced to take action!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Formosa, speaker Geng Lijun was wearing a Mao suit with a serious look on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice was loud and clear, and it was audible throughout the entire hall, within which were gathered several dozen reporters from all over the world, and countless cameras were flashing all around them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as Geng Lijun completed his address, a reporter raised their hand before standing up. \"May I ask what you're referring to when you say 'take action'?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Geng Lijun replied in a steely voice, \"Even now, the Cathayan Underworld still hasn't received any official communication from the Nipponese Underworld. The Nipponese Underworld insists on denying the incident or attempting to pin the blame on others, thereby preventing the issue from being resolved. The Cathayan Underworld will not tolerate any other underworld sending its armed forces into our territory without permission! This is an unprecedented act of aggression and disrespect! Due to the sinister nature of the incident, the Cathayan Underworld will be removing Formosa's Nipponese Embassy and temporarily cease all international relations with the Nipponese Underworld with immediate effect. All visas for citizens of the Nipponese Underworld traveling to Formosa will also be canceled, and the Nipponese Underworld's scientists will be temporarily kept out of the work conducted by the energy resource research and development committee.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the reporters in the hall erupted into a frenzy upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a one-sided cold war!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld was refusing all communication with the Nipponese Underworld, and the situation between the two nations had never been this grim!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Geng Lijun continued without pause, \"Of course, that won't be the extent of the measures taken by the Cathayan Underworld to address this issue. No underworld can trespass upon the Cathayan Underworld's territory without permission, and the Cathayan Underworld will certainly not allow foreign Yin soldiers to pass through its territory! The aforementioned transgressions are equivalent to acts of war! As for the final outcome of this incident, further observation will be required to determine that, but the worst outcomes are not out of the question.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A teacup was gently set down onto the table, and the entire conference hall fell deathly silent in response to the television broadcast.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a spacious conference hall with pronounced Nipponese-style décor. At the center of the hall was a round timber table, around which were a series of televisions that had been embedded into the walls. At this moment, the live broadcast of the Cathayan Underworld's press conference were playing out on all of the television screens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Geng Lijun's voice wasn't overly loud, but it was like rumbling thunder in the ears of those in the conference hall, and none of them dared to say anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami was sitting on the main seat, and seated alongside her were Susanoo-no-Mikoto, Tamamo-no-Mae, Shuten-doji, and several other powerful yokai.

That is the only way we can communicate with the Cathayan Underworld at the moment. Alternatively, you could call the Cathayan Underworld to negotiate something.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I tried that, and they refused,\" Izanami replied.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Emperor Sutoku gave a cold harrumph. \"So they want to resolve this matter, but they're refusing to communicate with us. What exactly is the Cathayan Underworld trying to do?! Does it think that it owns the entirety of Asia?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone could sense that a storm was coming, but no one knew what the cause of the storm was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">International affairs were an extension of domestic politics. This had always been a fact.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Did this mean that something had gone wrong in the Cathayan Underworld?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No. On the contrary, it was in a period of rapid growth, raking in astronomical sums of money every single day! With that in mind, this simply didn't make any sense!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Was there someone from the international stage exerting pressure on the Cathayan Underworld?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That wasn't the case, either. No one would dare to exert pressure on the Cathayan Underworld unless they wanted to be threatened with nationwide power outages. Case in point: even a figure as high and mighty as Yamaraja had swallowed his pride and was treating Qin Ye with the utmost respect.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There are only two possible ways that we can proceed right now,\" Emperor Sutoku said through gritted teeth. \"One, we hold a press conference and declare to the world that this incident has nothing to do with our Nipponese Underworld. The problem is that the ship and all of the people involved have been detained, and the so-called Nipponese Yin soldiers have been wiped out by the governor and the administrative commissioner, so we have no leads.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tamamo-no-Mae had a head of shoulder-length black hair, and she was wearing a fox mask and a black kimono. Her voice was full of seduction as she said, \"But wouldn't that be a direct provocation to the Cathayan Underworld? As you know, all of the supposed evidence is in their hands. If they insist on pursuing this matter, then there's nothing we can do. The most important thing is whether they intend to take this further or not.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they were to deny trespassing on the Cathayan Underworld's territory, only for the Cathayan Underworld to release a series of evidence to the contrary, that would be an extremely awkward situation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, it gave the Cathayan Underworld the impression that the Nipponese Underworld was refusing to admit to its faults and bow its head. However, the question was: what did the Cathayan Underworld want to gain from forcing the Nipponese Underworld into submission? Was it just a show of strength?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they really were seeking to start a war, then there was no way that the Nipponese Underworld would be able to survive!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone was hoping against hope that the Cathayan Underworld would defuse the situation eventually, but the chances of that were getting slimmer and slimmer.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What's our second option?\" Izanami asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Contact the Hindustani Underworld and hope that they'll act as mediator,\" Emperor Sutoku sighed. \"It's the duty of the four pillars to ensure peace in the underworld, so this is not a request that they can refuse.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami took several minutes to consider the situation, then decided, \"Hold a press conference, and also contact the Hindustani Underworld at the same time. Regardless of whether the Cathayan Underworld defuses the situation or not, we have to clarify why exactly it's doing this! Yanluo Qin can refuse to speak to us, but he can't do the same to Yamaraja.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She rose to her feet and cast a grim gaze toward all of the yokai in the room. \"We are the only independent Asian underworld left to the east of the Cathayan Underworld, so we are the most heavily impacted by its return to its position as one of the four pillars. Hence, we have to resolve this issue no matter what!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Understood.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Go,\" Izanami said as she waved a dismissive hand, then added, \"Susanoo-no-Mikoto, please stay behind.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the yokai departed, and soon, Izanami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto were the only ones left in the room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a full 10 minutes of silence did Izanami speak again. \"Come on a walk with me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her pristine white kimono trailed over the ground like a cloud, and several servants immediately followed along behind her, gently picking up the hem of her kimono.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two of them walked along in silence, each absorbed in their own thoughts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They turned a corner into a passageway with reliefs of the Hyakki Yagyō on the walls. It was unclear where this passageway led to, but the deeper they went, the more Yin soldiers there were. At the same time, there were also many Yin rune restrictions concealed within the reliefs, and they were flashing incessantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The passageway was very long, roughly around 100 meters in length. The two of them had only walked around 20 meters before Susanoo-no-Mikoto suddenly raised his head and cast his gaze toward Izanami. Izanami's expression remained unchanged, while Susanoo-no-Mikoto opened his mouth, as if to say something, but decided against it in the end, and the two of them continued onward in silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the end of the passageway was a stone gate that was riddled with engraved restrictions and was also carrying motifs of the three divine artifacts. The aura emanating from the restrictions was quite powerful, but what was strange about it was that one wouldn't be able to sense it at all from any distance in excess of 10 meters away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By the time the two of them arrived, the stone gate had already been opened by the Yin soldiers on either side of it, revealing a golden shimenawa, beyond which was a boundless expanse of darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto stepped over the shimenawa, upon which they arrived in a spacious and luxurious courtyard that was over 200 square meters in area.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a classic Nipponese-style dry garden, and there were many servants standing in the courtyard, but every single one of them was an Anitya Hellguard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You think... it has something to do with him?\" Susanoo-no-Mikoto asked as he turned to face Izanami.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami closed her eyes and took a deep breath before replying, \"Aside from this, I can't think of any other reason. All rulers need to leave their mark on the world. Ever since the first King Yanluo passed the throne onto the second King Yanluo, the Cathayan Underworld was destined to be different from other underworlds in that its ruler could be replaced without warning. That's why the world wasn't all that stunned when Yanluo Qin ascended to the throne. The first King Yanluo established Hell, while the second King Yanluo took the Cathayan Underworld to unprecedented heights. What is the third King Yanluo's legacy going to be? What is he going to leave behind?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The new energy resource?\" Susanoo-no-Mikoto asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes, but that's not enough,\" Izanami replied as she opened her eyes. \"Just the new energy resource alone isn't enough to compete with the grand achievements of his two predecessors. On top of that, he wasn't the one who developed the new energy resource. If he wants to leave his mark on the world, don't you think this is a very good incision point? If 'he' is returned to his homeland, the entire Cathayan Underworld would praise Yanluo Qin. After all, there are very few figures in Cathayan history who's viewed as more heroic than he is. Aside from that, I can't think of a better explanation for the Cathayan Underworld inexplicable actions.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A door was slowly opened to reveal a brightly lit room. At the very center of the room was a man who was drinking alone, and he didn't even raise his head to acknowledge his visitors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami put on a gentle smile as she said, \"We've come to visit you again, Yue Fei.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yue Fei continued to ignore them, looking as if he hadn't heard her at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Susanoo-no-Mikoto's brows furrowed tightly as he said, \"There are very few people who are definitively aware that Yue Fei is in the Nipponese Underworld, including a small handful of the Cathayan Underworld's highest-ranking officials and you and me. If they really are coming for him, then the situation is very troublesome...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They would either have to hand over Yue Fei or accept the sanctions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, they were still completely oblivious to just how much danger they were in, thinking that this was still just a foreign affairs dispute.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never did they think that the Cathayan Underworld was truly coming for their throats!</span></p>"

It was no exaggeration to say that with the inter-realm mirrors in place, the Nipponese Underworld would be able to contend with 10 times the number of Yin soldiers than in its own military!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the system of the inter-realm mirrors was flawed, and the only flaw came in the form of the three yokai of the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were the only evil ghosts who could enter the Nipponese Underworld without using the inter-realm mirrors, and this was an arrangement that Izanami had to accept due to the special nature of their identities.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After going beyond the shimenawa ropes of the three yokai, one would reach the Chubu region, and a large number of ships was required to take Hell's troops from Chubu to Hokkaido.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Having clarified its own thoughts, the paper figure replied in a respectful voice, \"I understand what you want, Your Excellency.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Oh?\" Qin Ye raised an eyebrow upon hearing this.

As for the Tojinbo Waterfalls, they only have a very minor connection to those two yokai.

Izanami agreed to this, but as they met, Izanami said, \"What a handsome man you are.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanagi also said, \"What a beautiful woman you are.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was considered to be an omen of misfortune for the woman to have spoken first, but Izanagi paid that no heed. Not long after that, they gave birth to their first child, and he was called Hiruko.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In Nipponese, the term \"Hiruko\" referred to infants with incomplete development, and that applied to this Hiruko as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was born as a ball of rotten flesh without any bones or organs. Izanagi felt this to be too misfortunate an omen to ignore, so they abandoned him, and only after that did the legend of Izanagi and Izanami's creation of the human race arise.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So this Hiruko no Kami...\" Qin Ye began.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figure immediately explained, \"He is the same Hiruko that was abandoned in Nipponese mythology. After creating humans, the dirt on Izanagi's body formed the Hyakki Yagyō. However, the abandoned Hiruko was also thought of as dirt, and he drifted to a place near the Sandanbeki Rock Cliff, where he was stopped by a rock. From then onward, he harbored boundless resentment toward his own parents, and any living being that entered his territory would die without exception. That area has already transformed into a true domain of ghosts, and in order to hide this controversy, Izanami didn't allow Hiruko no Kami to enter the underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I see...&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response as his eyes narrowed slightly.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was confident that this Hiruko no Kami would be willing to let them through into the Nipponese Underworld. This was the best piece of news he had received since he arrived in Nippon!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figure continued, \"Your Excellency, you may think that Hiruko no Kami resents the Nipponese Underworld, but his hatred is nothing compared with what is harbored by the one in Aokigahara! On top of that, Aokigahara in the underworld is a cursed region of the sea that'll devour even Yin spirits, and it's directly connected to the Nippon Sea! No Yin spirits can approach the area unless they're at least at the Anitya Hellguard level, and I think that is the best target for you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Oh?\" Qin Ye raised an eyebrow with an intrigued expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figure asked, \"Your Excellency, have you heard of Amanozako?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye shook his head in response. This was a very unfamiliar name to him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paper figure explained, \"Her full name is Amanozako Himekami, and she is a manifestation of Susanoo-no-Mikoto's rage. She has the body of a human but the head of a beast. Her appearance is extremely hideous, but her powers rival those of Susanoo-no-Mikoto! Susanoo-no-Mikoto also abandoned her as he despised her appearance. On top of that, when the Nipponese Underworld was first founded, Izanami didn't invite Amanozako into the underworld as she didn't want to give Susanoo-no-Mikoto a powerful ally.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Sure enough, this was a world where looks were imperative.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Those who were too hideous didn't even have the right to be retained by their parents!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye set that train of thought aside and nodded in response. If he could form a collaborative relationship with those two, then the foundation for the attack on the Nipponese Underworld would already be laid. All that would be left would be to complete the second-generation forbidden arts and the launching technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he had no plans to approach Amanozako and Hiruko at the moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Mitsubishi Consortium needed time to develop submarines, but Amanozako and Hiruko could open up their pathways into the underworld at any time, so they required no time to prepare. If he were to discuss terms with them now, they would most likely ask for exorbitant compensation, and there was also the possibility that their allegiances could shift over time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that, Qin Ye had accomplished everything he had come to Nippon to do. The initial interaction with the Mitsubishi Corporation was a resounding success, and all that was left to do was to find opportunities to begin collaborating in secret.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His body began to vanish as gusts of Yin wind as he declared, \"During the Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference in the underworld in half a year's time, I'll have some good news to present to you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thank you for gracing us with your presence!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, Qin Ye reappeared on a certain street in Tokyo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the most developed city in all of Asia, it was an understatement to call Tokyo a city that never slept. However, despite all the bright lights and lavish extravagance, the sorrow of what was once the world's number one city could not be disguised.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the 1980s, Nippon's GDP was over 70% of Usonia's, and Tokyo also leapfrogged New York to become the undisputed number one city in the world. However, following a financial crisis in the 1990s, everything came crashing down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, even now, no other city in Asia had managed to surpass it. The foundation that it had accumulated was far too massive, and many of the things that were in the city now were left behind in the wake of that popped financial bubble.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An example of that was the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, which was right ahead of Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was once the Tokyo residence of a feudal lord, but it was later renovated into the national garden. It spanned an area of close to 60 hectares, and it was the undisputed number one garden in Tokyo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The after-effects of the financial crisis could still be seen here. Even though house prices had already dropped to around 50,000 to 60,000 RMB per square meter in the non-central parts of Tokyo, which was an absolute bargain compared to house prices in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, but there were still far too many jobless, homeless people sleeping on the benches in the park at night. In fact, there were a few in front of Qin Ye right at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had just purchased a plane ticket for the next day, and he didn't feel like sleeping, so he strolled into the park. He wanted to see what had become of this once-extravagant city that had left the likes of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Seoul in the dust.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The night was extremely peaceful, and the only sounds that could be heard were the occasional car horn, as well as the rustling of the tree branches in the night breeze. Qin Ye slowly strode along the path in the garden, enjoying a rare moment of peace.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were many stone lampstands from a long-gone era on either side of the path, and some of them were already covered in moss.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as Qin Ye was walking past one of the antiquated lamps, an azure flame suddenly appeared within it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye immediately cast his gaze toward that direction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Immediately thereafter, azure netherfire lit up in all of the lamps that lined the path!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The night breeze turned into a howling gale, causing all of the trees in the park to shriek like countless howling ghosts. Qin Ye's eyes narrowed slightly as he looked around in disbelief.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who could've discovered me? Since when did Nippon have a Yama-King? Alternatively, could it be a coincidence?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a strong gust of wind arose behind him as if it had torn open this space before blowing directly toward him from behind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Whoever it was, they hadn't concealed their Yin energy at all, and Qin Ye was just about to retaliate when his expression changed ever so slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This attack wasn't imbued with any Yin energy, it was just a pure attack!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was extremely fast, so much so that sonic booms were erupting through the air, and the assailant was clearly a veteran of the battlefield, but this was nowhere near enough to pose a threat to Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't even turn around as he reached behind himself, catching the tip of the oncoming spear between his fingers with unerring accuracy before turning around with eyes that were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No matter who it was, they couldn't be allowed to live after discovering him!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, right as he caught sight of his assailant, his pupils immediately contracted slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was an acquaintance, one that he had never thought that he would meet here!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Am I not even worthy of having you face my attack head-on now?\" A familiar male voice rang out from behind Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye turned around with an incredulous expression. A young man was standing behind him, looking directly at him with a complex smile on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His features were quite ordinary, not handsome nor hideous, and he was wearing a kimono. There was no one around him, and he was holding a three-meter-long spear, with a tip that was a meter in length on its own.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the renowned Nipponese spear, Tonbokiri!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Honda Tadakatsu...\" Qin Ye's long hair was flapping behind him in the Yin wind like a pair of crow's wings. \"How did you find me?\"</span></p>"

Now that the three pillars have backed down, we've been left out to dry. Our top priority now is to repair our relationship with the Cathayan Underworld.

Thus, the Nipponese Underworld has no foreign aid whatsoever, and if the Cathayan Underworld were to make a resurgence, it would loom over the Nipponese Underworld like an all-encompassing shadow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, they had no choice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"To think that Ashikaga Yoshiaki is still trying to take advantage of this opportunity to take the daimyos down a peg? Is he blind? Just how stupid can he be?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In her eyes, the presence of the three regents at this conference would exacerbate the internal conflict within the Nipponese Underworld, but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. In an underworld without any other advanced Abyssal Prefects, she was the undisputed ruler!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Daitengu said, \"You haven't even said anything, yet he's making a move in your stead, so he's completely overstepping the boundaries of his authority. It seems that he doesn't know exactly who it was that gave him the power that he enjoys now. If it wasn't for you, there's no way he would've been able to suppress those daimyos. We're only using him as a puppet, yet he's deluded himself into thinking that he's someone important. What a hopeless fool he is!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yanluo Qin!\" Yamaraja's attitude toward Qin Ye had taken a complete 180-degree turn compared with 10 years ago. As soon as Qin Ye made his way into the temple, he immediately rushed over and grabbed Qin Ye's hand with both of his own. Even the three glowing red eyes under his black hood were curved up at the corners as if they were smiling.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long time no see! I've really missed you.\" He was shaking Qin Ye's hand as if they were the closest of friends, and countless cameras immediately began to flash around them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Indeed, I've also missed you greatly. Come to think of it, this is my first time here at the Hindustani Underworld, and it's far more beautiful than I imagined.\" Qin Ye was also playing along, acting as if they were old friends who had been reunited after a long separation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That sure is a glowing compliment coming from you, Yanluo Qin.\" Yamaraja was holding onto Qin Ye's hand, and it was as if he had completely forgotten how he had treated Qin Ye during the conference in Nara and the Great Revelation Debate. Even as he began to move through the hall, he was still holding onto Qin Ye's hand and dragging him along.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Goosebumps were being raised all over Qin Ye's body from the excessive display of affection.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is all thanks to the Cathayan Underworld.\" He smiled as he waved at the sea of cameras while walking along beside Qin Ye. \"If it wasn't for the invention of the new energy resource, the entire underworld would still be in the dark ages.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long time no see, Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Have you been well, Yanluo Qin?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, Anubis popped up, seemingly out of nowhere, wearing a whole host of gold, jade, and diamond accessories as he grabbed onto Qin Ye's other hand with a wide smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meanwhile, Thanatos withdrew his hand in an awkward manner, cursing the human anatomy for only having two hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instead, he held onto Anubis's other hand so that the ruler death gods of the four pillars formed a line in order to not make himself look so awkward.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had been over 100 years since the rulers of the four pillars had come together in peace and harmony, and all of the surrounding cameras were flashing incessantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The flashing lights of the cameras formed a sea of radiance, and Qin Ye's eyes narrowed slightly. He couldn't help but feel intoxicated by this feeling of standing at the pinnacle of the world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a full minute had passed did the flashing lights gradually subside, and Yamaraja cleared his throat as he said, \"Everyone, there is still half an hour until the commencement of the conference. Why don't we enter the venue now to see if everyone is satisfied with the location. If there are any complaints, we can make adjustments right away.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone was in agreement with the idea, and the Qin Ye nodded at the three death gods before entering the venue first. Thanatos was the last one in the line, and his smile slowly faded as he watched Qin Ye's departing figure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What do you think of this?\" he asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yamaraja's eyes narrowed slightly in response. \"What do you mean?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Asia-Pacific Economic Development Conference is imperative to the direction that the world's economy takes, and it's always been hosted by the Hindustani Underworld and the Cathayan Underworld together. However, on this occasion, the Hindustani Underworld is only hosting two minor conferences, while the Cathayan Underworld is holding three major conferences and five minor conferences. Why did you make such a big concession?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yamaraja didn't reply.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The power balance of the world was slowly shifting. Ever since the Cathayan Underworld's aggressive resurgence, the entire world had become reliant on its new energy resource, so there was no longer any way for them to suppress the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Economic sanctions simply wouldn't work, and as for military sanctions, the Cathayan Underworld seemed to have never feared sanctions of that nature.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Asia had already been split up into two major sections, with the Hindustani Underworld controlling the Indonesian Islands, the Maluku Islands, and the world's gate in the Australis Underworld, as well as the Strait of Tsushima. As for the rest, including Southern Asia, and the Nipponese Underworld, that was all in the Cathayan Underworld's sphere of influence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Continuing the conflict wouldn't help the situation at all, and after the past decade of developments, Yamaraja no longer had much confidence that other underworlds would continue to stand by him. After all, national power outages were no joke and could easily spark mass Yin spirit protests and riots.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, under these circumstances, the three pillars chose to back down and allow the Cathayan Underworld to recover its influence and speaking rights in the world. Thanatos was well aware of this, but he was rather reluctant to accept it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After all, the three pillars had reigned supreme for over 100 years, and it hurt him greatly to relinquish the power that he had accumulated during that time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The times are constantly changing,\" Yamaraja said as he slowly made his way into the venue. \"Sometimes, the pendulum swings to one side, and at other times, it swings to the other side. It's clear that we won't be blessed by the times for at least the next century. Rather than trying to fight the natural order, it's much wiser for us to wait until the pendulum naturally swings in our favor. There are no eternal empires in this world, that's something everyone knows, is it not?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanatos didn't say anything, and only after a long while did he heave a faint sigh before entering the venue as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In any case, the Argosian Underworld was the farthest of the three pillars from the Cathayan Underworld. The first of the three pillars that would have to face the pressure of the Cathayan Underworld's resurgence would be the Hindustani Underworld, followed by the Aegyptian Underworld, while the Argosian Underworld would be the last to be affected.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Prior to the development of internet technology, the Cathayan Underworld wouldn't be able to impact them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So be it.\" With that in mind, his gloomy mood was lightened a little. \"Let me see what surprises the Cathayan Underworld has in store for this international conference.\"</span></p>"

If there were no benefits to be reaped from a war, then it would become entirely pointless.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Prior to lashing out at the Nipponese Underworld, the Cathayan Underworld had to consider how to conduct its invasion, as well as which parts to conquer and which parts to relinquish. This involved a series of decisions that had been made over the course of several years of meticulous planning and inspection. However, once the decisions were made and things were set into motion, everything would quickly escalate into an all-consuming tsunami.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, none of the death gods in the underworld had realized exactly what was on the horizon. Thus, no one paid much attention to this incident. After all, it was far more important for them to look after their own nation's domestic affairs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Similarly, Izanami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto were also not overly concerned. They slowly made their way into the room, and a servant immediately closed the door behind them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A middle-aged man with a long beard was seated on a tatami mat with his side facing them, and he didn't even bother to turn around to face them directly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was quite thin with a jaded look in his eyes, and he wasn't very tall, roughly 178 centimeters in height. He was wearing an antiquated Cathayan robe, and he was holding a wine cup in his callous-covered hand. He didn't even raise his head as he asked, \"What do you want this time?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami didn't reply. Instead, she inspected her surroundings with a reminiscent look in her eyes, and only after a long while did she break her silence. \"Truth be told, I really do admire you very much. Once again, the doors of the Nipponese Underworld are open to you at any time. If you decide to join us, you'll be treated with the utmost reverence and respect.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Yue Fei's face. After the passage of over 1,000 years, he had developed a graceful and refined disposition.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gently set down his cup as he said, \"You've already been telling that joke for over 1,000 years. Haven't you gotten bored of it yet?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami remained unfazed as she countered in a calm voice, \"You've been staying in this room for over 1,000 years. Don't you feel miserable?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She heaved a faint sigh, then continued in a gentle voice, \"You've already been here for over 1,000 years. During that time, you haven't set foot outside of this room even once. Do you know how much the Cathayan Underworld has changed? Don't you want to go back to take a look?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yue Fei finally turned around with a smile on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The right half of his body, from his neck to his chest, had completely disappeared, and the wound was riddled with countless teeth marks!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The wound was impossible to heal, and Yin energy was slowly pouring out of it, giving him an extremely ghastly appearance. However, Yue Fei didn't seem to be able to feel anything as he asked, \"You want me to go back like this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto's expressions changed slightly upon seeing this, yet before they had a chance to say anything, Yue Fei pressed his hands against the table and supported himself up into a standing position with great effort, then panted, \"You are not the true ruler of the Nipponese Underworld! There was a death god here before you, and you didn't create the Nipponese Underworld! You are plagued by Their blood maggots, constantly leaving you on the brink of death, and only by devouring my flesh can your symptoms be alleviated. Then again, I don't need to tell you all that, do I?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, according to Nipponese legends, the Nipponese Underworld wasn't created by Izanami. She had entered the Nipponese Underworld and eaten the food there, thereby rendering her unable to ever return to the mortal realm. Furthermore, in her attempt to escape, she was beset by the curse of blood maggots.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In other words, she had never attained the acknowledgment of the Nipponese Underworld. The Nipponese Underworld only wanted to retain a god so that it would be able to operate as normal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">So who was the one that had created the Nipponese Underworld?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami didn't say anything, but Yue Fei wasn't done yet. \"First comes a nation, then comes the legends and religions, and that gives rise to death gods. Prior to your emergence, there was only one Nipponese emperor, and that was Emperor Jimmu, the one known as the son of the gods. Do you really not know who Emperor Jimmu is?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He suddenly burst into raucous laughter before continuing, \"If you didn't know, then you wouldn't have pursued my soul so desperately! For that cause, all of the first generation of great yokai lost their lives, and only Tamamo-no-Mae and Shuten-doji remain! Even the likes of Nurarihyon and Tsuchigumo all perished in that battle in Nanjing! Only the Yin energy of the Cathayan Underworld can suppress the blood maggots because that is a curse from our Cathayan Underworld. Throughout all of history, you've been nothing more than the spokesperson of the Cathayan Underworld in the province of Nippon! This underworld was created by Xu Fu! There's no way that a lowly Abyssal Prefect such as yourself would've been able to create all of this!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that Yue Fei's voice trailed off, a vicious slap landed on his face, and there was such force behind the slap that his head was flung to the side. Immediately thereafter, countless strands of black hair wound themselves around him like a pit of snakes, constricting him viciously from all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Insolence!\" Izanami said in a cold voice. \"I respect you, but that doesn't mean you can say whatever you please. Seeing as you don't want to live, I'll take you one step closer to death!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as her voice trailed off, her head abruptly expanded in size, and Yin energy permeated throughout the entire room before transforming into an inky-black vortex. From within the Yin energy, countless bright red maggots emerged from beneath her skin like demonic spawn, while she opened her mouth up wide.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yue Fei was bound by her hair, rendering him completely unable to evade, so he could only allow her to sink her teeth into his wound.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A string of chewing noises rang out incessantly, and even though Yue Fei was having his soul devoured alive, he didn't even so much as wince in pain. Only after a meal that lasted a full 10 minutes did Izanami withdraw her Yin energy and return to her original form.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She pulled out her handkerchief and gently dabbed at her own mouth, then said with a disdainful expression, \"I've given you many chances in the past, but you've never cherished them! All you can do now is run your mouth, you can't even recover your cultivation rank! I've passed the curse of the blood maggots onto you as well, and your cultivation rank has plummeted to only the Soul Hunter level. Aside from serving as a food source to relieve my pain, you're nothing but a useless piece of trash! If you had been more obedient, you would've spared yourself a lot of torment.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, she departed from the room. Susanoo-no-Mikoto had remained silent this entire time, and he also departed, closing the door behind him as he did so.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After leaving the room, Izanami stopped in her tracks and raised her head to look up at the sky. Only after a long while did she break her silence. \"He's right. Once I realized that the blood maggot curse didn't originate from Nippon, I searched for its origins all over the world. The first place that I searched was the Nipponese Underworld, and I was very fortunate to have been able to trace it back to Xu Fu. However, I couldn't tell him that I had been afflicted by his curse as that would only put me at his mercy. Hence, I needed the soul of a high-grade Emissary of Hell to alleviate my pain.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She heaved a forlorn sign as she slowly strolled forward. \"He was once an Abyssal Prefect, but he's only a Soul Hunter now. At the very most, his soul will only be able to last 100 more years. Do you think I can let him go back now?

She doesn't have many troops under her command, but her powers are almost comparable with those of Susanoo-no-Mikoto! Once the war begins, Izanami will definitely travel to the front lines. She's still under the delusion that peace negotiations are possible. Once that happens, Shizuoka will be left unguarded, and Amanozako will be able to wreak havoc as she pleases there. All we need to do is break through the defenses between Aokigahara and the coastline to allow the Cathayan army to enter the sea, and everything will be as good as over!\"</span></p>"

No more than a week after the first press conference, the Cathayan Underworld held its second press conference.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the beginning, everyone had thought that this was only a foreign affairs incident, but in the short span of just a month, it had escalated to a dangerous extent. The Cathayan Underworld's voice was growing louder and louder, and its stance was becoming more and more aggressive. At this point, all of the death gods had already realized that something massive was about to happen in the Asia-Pacific.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, even after repeatedly reading through all of the reports on the major international events to have taken place this year, none of the death gods were able to gather any useful information, so all they could do was focus their attention on this press conference.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the spacious conference hall, Geng Lijun declared, \"... We are issuing yet another warning to the Nipponese Underworld. There is a limit to the Cathayan Underworld's patience! Do not think that you can just hide the truth by remaining silent! The Nipponese Underworld has ignored the Cathayan Underworld's statements over and over again, and the Cathayan Underworld has decided that if no satisfactory resolution is reached in two weeks, then it will be levying sanctions against the Nipponese Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A massive stir ran through the entire conference hall, and everyone was stunned by what they had just heard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The wording was so severe that it didn't just seem like sanctions anymore.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the silence, a reporter raised his hand, and Geng Lijun made an inviting hand gesture toward him, upon which the reporter rose to his feet and said, \"Esteemed spokesperson of the Cathayan Underworld, we noticed that the Cathayan Underworld seems to be extremely displeased with the Nipponese Underworld at the moment.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Geng Lijun raised a hand to stop him, then said, \"Correction: we are already at the end of our patience.

As for a joint investigation, why is that an arrangement that the Cathayan Underworld needs to accept? We already hold indisputable evidence in our hands. All the Nipponese Underworld needs to do is find out where the ship was built, whose soldiers were on the ship, and who issued the order for the deployment of the troops. How does that have anything to do with the Cathayan&nbsp;Underworld? We do not need to cooperate with the Nipponese Underworld, this should be an investigation that they launch by themselves.

It's clear that they're determined to strike at the Nipponese Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's all obvious,\" Hypnos said as he picked up his teacup before taking a sip. \"Every time the Cathayan Underworld has made a statement on this matter, they've mentioned the possibility of levying severe sanctions, and on no occasion have they ever denied the possibility of military sanctions. Do you think the Cathayan Underworld will actually attack the Nipponese Underworld?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after two full minutes of silence did Archimedes reply, \"It's actually... not impossible. I only realized this just now, but the Cathayan Underworld has turned down all of the three pillars' invitations to discuss this incident, and their wording has been extremely severe. It's like they're determined to pin the label of invaders onto the Nipponese Underworld. If you think about it, why would they want to do that? It's because if the label sticks, then the Cathayan Underworld's retaliation through military means will be categorized as self defense!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Aren't you overthinking things?\" another underworld emissary countered. \"In this day and age, any nation that dares to start a war will be sanctioned by the entire world!

Something had just occurred to him upon hearing the words \"sanctioned by the entire world\".</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How was the rest of the world going to sanction the Cathayan Underworld?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The price of the new energy resource had been dropping for several consecutive years, and the patents were still being held by the Cathayan Underworld, so no one could do anything to them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sense of growing unease was beginning to well up in his heart, and he took a large gulp of coffee before rising to his feet. \"Where is Erinys? Get her to take the Golden Fleet to the Strait of Tsushima right away! I'm going to contact Yamaraja and Izanami.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was nothing in this world that could be completely concealed. During the past few months, a tsunami had continuously been brewing in the Cathayan Underworld, and now that it was about to strike, it was inevitable that some signs would be revealed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, those signs weren't enough to make the rest of the world think that the Cathayan Underworld was going to initiate a war to bring down a nation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they were to do that, they would be attacked by the entire world!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, there was still a lingering sense of unease on the international stage. During the following two weeks, all of the death gods across the world made their attitudes known, expressing a desire to see a peaceful resolution to the Asia-Pacific incident, and the Nipponese Underworld was holding a press conference once every three days, bringing out all types of evidence to prove their innocence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A week later, the Argosian Underworld, the Aegyptian Underworld, and the Hindustani Underworld also stepped forward one after another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I think this is just a diplomatic incident. While it's true that the Nipponese Underworld is primarily at fault here, the Cathayan Underworld's treatment of this matter has not been conducive to achieving a peaceful resolution at all. We want the Asia-Pacific to remain peaceful, and we think that this matter can be resolved through peaceful means of negotiation.\" - Thanatos.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Cathayan Underworld and the Nipponese Underworld are the only two underworlds that still remain in Eastern Asia, and the two should be regarding one another as close allies. These two underworlds have had extensive trade and diplomatic relationships, and it would be far too unfortunate if this collaborative relationship that has lasted over 1,000 years were to be severed as a result of this diplomatic incident. I hope to be able to do my part in contributing to a peaceful resolution in this matter.\" - Anubis.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The esteemed ruler of the Hindustani Underworld, Yamaraja, has already contacted the esteemed ruler of the Cathayan Underworld, Yanluo Qin. Their conversation lasted over half an hour, and we are currently awaiting confirmation from the Cathayan Underworld. Once permission is issued by the Cathayan Underworld, the Hindustani Underworld will immediately hold a meeting between the leaders of the Cathayan, Hindustani, and Nipponese Underworlds to discuss a resolution to this major diplomatic incident.\" - The Ganges Daily.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three pillars had made their voices heard, but the only response that they received was a fourth press conference held by the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We are unsure of why the three pillars have determined this incident to be a diplomatic incident. In our eyes, this is a precursor for more sinister measures to be taken by the Nipponese Underworld against the Cathayan Underworld! Nippon has done the exact same thing in the mortal realm, and it cannot be trusted. The Cathayan Underworld reserves the right to determine whether this is a diplomatic incident or not.

Every underworld is the divine nation of death gods. At the very most, we are only servant gods.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tokugawa Ieyasu gently flapped his hand fan as he said in a cold voice, \"In the Nipponese Underworld, we feel no sense of belonging, only oppression and anguish.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"Alright, I can understand. I'll give you a few months to think about it, but before I let you go, I'm rather curious: what forced you to take this step?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What Qin Ye wanted was to find spokespeople for himself in the Nipponese Underworld. The Mitsubishi Consortium alone wasn't powerful enough, but the daimyos would complement them very well. The netherworldly citizens of the Nipponese Underworld revered them as heroes, so they would be far better spokespeople than the Mitsubishi Consortium.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, there was an element of uncertainty about them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were several points that had to be addressed before the invasion of the Nipponese Underworld could go ahead. Firstly, there was the attitude of all of the world's underworlds. Then came the development of the second-generation forbidden arts and the launching technology. Thirdly, spokespeople had to be found, and lastly, entrances to the underworld from the mortal realm had to be secured.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The conflict between the daimyos and the demons and gods of the Nipponese Underworld was an unexpected bonus. Even if the daimyos ultimately refused his offer, he still had other spokespeople that he could fall back on.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Toyotomi Hideyoshi was silent for a moment before a wry smile appeared on his face. \"Your Excellency, do you know why all past rulers are so heavily sought after by the ruler death gods when they enter the underworld?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was naturally aware of the reasons behind this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All emperors, even the most incompetent ones, had to be taken seriously once they entered the underworld as they were blessed by the fortune of their respective era!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps they couldn't compare with the likes of Chiyou, but they were still the focus of the fortune and faith of the entire nation. They were extremely valuable for bolstering divine nations, or could be used to elevate the religion of the ruler death god through avenues such as relayed dreams.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold smile appeared on Hōjō Tokimune's face as he said, \"The Nipponese Underworld is an exception to this.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye raised an eyebrow upon hearing this, and Hōjō Tokimune continued, \"Nippon's faith and fortune are focused on the emperor and the shoguns. We do not have the bloodline of the emperor, and it is the ultimate pursuit of all court nobles and samurais to become shoguns. While it's true that Hideyoshi-dono was the one who was actually in power in Nippon at the time, while Ieyasu-dono even established his own shogunate later, the actual shogun was Ashikaga Yoshiaki!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye faltered slightly upon hearing this before recalling the thin man in the blade official's robe accompanying Izanami.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Under normal circumstances, the name of Ashikaga Yoshiaki wouldn't have drawn his attention at all. However, as King Yanluo, it was important for him to get a good grasp on the representative teams of all of the underworlds prior to attending an international conference, and it was exactly because of this that he had a vague recollection of this rather unfamiliar name.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several centuries of hatred welled up in Toyotomi Hideyoshi's heart once, and he could barely contain himself as he said, \"During the Sengoku period, there was no shogunate in Nippon, but the concept still existed. It was accepted by all daimyos at the time that only the one who unified the nation would be able to establish a new shogunate. Prior to the unification of the nation, Ashikaga Yoshiaki held the status of shogun, but he was just a court jester, and no one cared to deal with him.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An enlightened look appeared in Qin Ye's eyes upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time, everyone was at war, so no one wanted to divert their forces to deal with a shogunate that only existed on an in-name basis.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Anyone who dared to strike at the shogunate would become the public enemy of all daimyos, and thus, under those peculiar circumstances, the shogunate survived, even though it was hanging by a thread.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Toyotomi Hideyoshi gritted his teeth as he said, \"However, no one anticipated that it would be me who united the nation. The problem is that there is an unofficial rule in Nippon, which is that only those of noble descent could found a shogunate. Unfortunately, I was only a farmer before I began my military career, so even though I had already united Nippon, there was always stern opposition to my desire to establish a shogunate.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I see.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye also recalled that Toyotomi Hideyoshi had never instated&nbsp;a shogunate, and it all made sense now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to the special state of Nippon at the time, after Toyotomi Hideyoshi united the nation, he had all types of daimyos serving him, many of whom were of noble descent, so they would have naturally been opposed to his desire to establish a shogunate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to his inability to become a shogun, Toyotomi Hideyoshi created the title of Taikō in a fit of rage, which was the ancient form of the regent title. From then onward, he became the \"retired emperor\" who was actually still in power.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the contrary, Tokugawa Ieyasu didn't have that issue. However, he had taken over from Toyotomi Hideyoshi by betraying him and starting a revolt, thereby plunging Nippon into the heat of war again, so his ascent to the throne was also not noble nor dignified.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the only one befitting the shogun title at the time turned out to be Ashikaga Yoshiaki.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the mortal realm, he was only the shogun in name alone&nbsp;without any actual jurisdictive power, but in the underworld, his title meant that he was the inheritor of the nation's fortune and faith.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Why isn't Ashikaga Yoshiaki standing on the same side as you?\" Qin Ye asked as he picked up his teacup before taking a sip.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the mention of that name, Honda Tadakatsu finally spoke for the first time. \"He wants nothing more than for us to die. Upon reaching his generation, the Ashikaga clan had already run out of capable successors. If it weren't for the wars that took place during the Sengoku period, the Ashikaga shogunate wouldn't have fallen so soon. We were the ones who destroyed his empire, so how could he not hate us? However, even Ieyasu-dono and Hideyoshi-dono have set aside their differences after entering the underworld, but Ashikaga Yoshiaki is still holding onto his grudge. Due to his status as a past shogun, he was treated as an esteemed guest by Izanami as soon as he entered the underworld, and it's all thanks to his constant effort to strike against us these past few centuries that we've ended up in such a sorry state.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only one from their era with any speaking rights in the Nipponese Underworld was Ashikaga Yoshiaki, and he was being used by Izanami as a pawn against the daimyos. It was already quite arduous for them to have survived to this point, and it was no wonder that not even a single emissary of the Nipponese Underworld had been sighted back at the Strait of Tsushima.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, Qin Ye nodded in response. The faction of demons and gods was the established force in the underworld, so they naturally didn't want any competition. However, the collective force of the daimyos was too powerful for them to completely eradicate. Unfortunately, none of the daimyos had any fortune or faith after entering the underworld, so it was as if fate had played a cruel joke on them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I can see how you've ended up in such a difficult position.\" He raised his teacup to bid the regents farewell. \"Have a good think about my offer. I look forward to hearing your response.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We'll be sure to consider the offer carefully and give you a response as soon as possible!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the modern underworld where the new energy resource had already become prevalent, information had become far more accessible than before.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were televisions and newspapers, through which one could keep up with daily affairs. Phones were still in the 3G era, so they were a little slow, and the internet was still under development. However, it was already a significant improvement from the days of communication through messenger birds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the Nipponese Underworld immediately received news of the Cathayan Underworld's lowering of its new energy resource costs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Yatarō was pacing back and forth in his room in an urgent manner. No one was more anxious than he was, as this was the day that the Cathayan Underworld was supposed to fulfill the first part of its promise to him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was holding a newspaper as he quickly paced back and forth, feeling as if he had the weight of the entire world on his shoulders. Due to the Heavenly Dao vow he had signed, he couldn't share this information with anyone else in the Mitsubishi Consortium, and his mind was racing so quickly that figurative sparks were flying.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a long while, he sat down in front of his low tea table before opening the newspaper again. He had already read this newspaper far too many times, but he felt like he could never get enough of reading it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The preparations for the war efforts, yet Izanami is still completely oblivious.\" He licked his lips as a sharp look appeared in his eyes. \"Then again, she isn't entirely to blame. If I hadn't been informed in advance, I wouldn't have been able to make the connection, either. This is where the first step begins!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By offering such a brilliant opportunity to the rest of Asia, the other Asian underworlds would be far less vehement in their objections once the war between the two nations commenced.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The lowering of the energy resource costs is only the first step. The second step would be their true objective, which is to open up the Nipponese Underworld!\" he murmured to himself as he stared intently at the newspaper. \"Everyone who has come down into the underworld from the six major corporations of the mortal realm in the past 100 years, the daimyos, and even ourselves... All of us are being considered for the base station construction rights! With this injection of funds, we'll be able to develop submarines faster, and our interactions with the Cathayan Underworld will take place on an official basis, so no suspicions will be aroused! Because of how wide a scope this declaration encompasses, Izanami won't be able to single out the connection between the Cathayan Underworld and the daimyos, as well as our Mitsubishi Consortium. There's no way that she'll be able to predict the danger that's coming from both the sea and from land. Of course, that's because the shimenawa ropes of the three great yokai in the mortal realm have still yet to be opened, so she has no sense of urgency or danger. What a brilliant plan this is...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He heaved a long sigh, then closed the newspaper as unbridled excitement appeared in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The times had changed...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The most drastic change in the underworld for the past few centuries was about to commence, and he couldn't wait for it to begin!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gently tapped the small bell sitting on the corner of his table, and soon, a man in a suit made his way into the room before extending a bow. \"Is there something you need from me, Chairman?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Grab the relevant documents and apply for base station construction rights from the Cathayan Underworld right away!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The man faltered slightly upon hearing this. \"Chairman, is this really an opportunity that we could be considered for?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Just do as I say! How will you know if we can secure this opportunity if we don't try?\" Iwasaki Yatarō replied in an urgent voice. \"At the same time, cease development on all other projects and focus solely on the development of submarines!\"</span></p>"

In the next instant, a vast expanse of inky-black Yin energy spread over the entire Shinto shrine, and even the lanterns and canopies of the trees outside were rustling incessantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The divine official stood off to the side in a respectful manner, but he was constantly looking behind himself. More and more netherworldly citizens were rushing up the mountain, while the ships on the sea were becoming clearer and clearer.

All of the artifacts and food items offered up in the shrine were scattered everywhere, and before he had a chance to do anything, a massive golden eye had already appeared behind the shimenawa.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Yamat<span style=\"; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">a-no-</span>Orochi, the yokai and protector of Kyushu.

However, there were still many Yin soldiers gathering on the coast and on the streets. There were roughly 10,000 of them, and they were all rushing toward the oncoming ships with their spears raised in resistance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How futile,\" he sighed as he withdrew his gaze, then massaged his own glabella with a pained expression. \"This is the Cathayan Underworld!

Illuminated by the light of the karmic flames, the ironclad warships of the Cathayan Underworld were given a downright demonic appearance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ships were all interconnected with one another to form an indestructible formation, and with the pulling force generated by the spears that had been launched earlier, the ships were able to travel at an astonishing speed. At this point, all of the Yin soldiers of the Nipponese Underworld could already see the flags flapping in the wind on all of the ships.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">We're about to reach land...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the ship at the very center of the fleet stood Qin Changxin, Qin Xinzhong, Mori Ranmaru, and all of the other evil ghosts that had come from the Obsidian Heaven’s Eye Bowl.

With that raised arm as a signal, the sound of long horns rang out over the entire surface of the sea, immediately following which the neighs of at least 30,000 skeletal warhorses erupted in unison. Each warhorse was carrying a Yin soldier on its back, and the entire army was raring to go.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Break through their defenses!\" Qin Changxin roared with all his might, then shot forth as a streak of light, landing on a giant three-meter-tall skeletal warhorse at the forefront of the army before raising the longsword in his hand. \"Follow me!

The sight of tens of thousands of skeletal warhorses on the charge at once was truly an astonishing one to behold, and the entire surface of the sea was swaying like an enormous, shattered gemstone. The entire army was giving off incredible killing intent as they charged toward the coastline with unstoppable might.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The spear-wielding foot soldiers of the Nipponese Underworld had already set up a defensive barricade, and their spears were gleaming under the moonlight.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two sides were about to clash, but no one was taking so much as a single backward step.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Retreat was not an option!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"By Hell’s Dictum, all rabble shall disperse!\" Amid the collective voices of 30,000 troops, the cavalry of the Cathayan Underworld embarked on a ferocious charge. They were like waves of the sea, crashing toward the coastline one after another. During their advance, black and white light rose up from beneath their feet, and a series of black characters appeared in the air around them, giving them the appearance of a divine army that had descended from the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the Wumu military formation!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The distance between the Cathayan Underworld's forces and the coastline was quickly being closed down.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both sides could see the killing intent in the eyes of the enemy, and right at this moment, someone suddenly exclaimed, \"That's the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: -0.16px; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">Demon King of the Sixth Heaven</span></span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone faltered slightly upon hearing this, following which a string of alarmed cries erupted throughout the Nipponese Underworld's ranks. \"It really is Oda Nobunaga!

The sound of rumbling war drums and deafening long horns rang out incessantly, and by the time all of the troops arrived at the coastline, they discovered that the entire surface of the sea had already been illuminated golden and red by countless lights.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were the lights of the countless ships that had been painstakingly built by Zhou Yu's naval forces during the past few years.

In Nippon, the jurisdictive scope of counties and cities was the exact opposite to that of Cathay, so there were 12 cities under Nagasaki County.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The city of the Sasebo was situated near the northernmost part of Nagasaki, and it neighbored the Strait of Tsushima. The city of Sasebo was situated far away from the mainland of the Nipponese Underworld, and it had an important strategic location as it was directly across the sea from the other half of Nagaski County.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This city was known for abundant production in seafood, but that actually wasn't the case.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second nuclear weapon dropped onto Nippon in the mortal realm was at Nagasaki, and this resulted in pollution of large areas of the sea near the county. Due to the laws of Yin Yang co-action, the contaminated and mutated souls were also mutated once they entered the underworld. Birds and animals were directly reborn instead of entering the cycle of reincarnation, so there were still many mutated sea beasts in the sea around Nagasaki in the underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This had a severe impact on the fishing industry of Nagasaki, but there was nothing anyone could do to combat nature. Thus, Nagasaki should've been a major producer of seafood, but its fishing industry was actually in a massive slump.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In a seaside izakaya restaurant in Sasebo, a man heaved a long sigh before setting down his cup.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gave off a strong scent of the sea, and the same was also true for the two men beside him. The man had a white towel wrapped around his head, and he was looking out through the window at the inky-black surface of the sea. Only after a long while did he heave a long sigh. \"It's getting harder and harder to earn a living in this industry.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Indeed.\" The man beside him took a sip of sake, and his face was slightly flushed as he said, \"Less than half of the things that we catch are actually fit for consumption. If nothing changes soon, I'm going back to Shikoku.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The final Yin spirit in the group was a short and chubby man, and he also took a sip of sake before chiming, \"We can only hope that the heavens decide to grace us with a miracle. Let's not talk about these things. It's not every day that we can get together like this, so let's just drink and forget all of that other stuff.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The other Yin spirits raised their cups with wry smiles. \"Indeed, we can only hope for a miracle.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three touched their cups with one another, and right as they were about to drink, one of them cast an errant gaze out the window. However, the sight that he was greeted by almost made him spit out his sake, and he immediately sprang to his feet before looking out the window with a horrified expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What's wrong, Kameda-san?\" One of the other Yin spirits turned toward him with a perplexed expression, yet Kameda was too shocked by what he had seen to reply. All he could do was raise a hand before pointing a trembling finger outside, while the netherfire in his eyes flickered erratically, and he couldn't utter even a single word.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two Yin spirits turned around with puzzled expressions, and the sight that greeted them made them immediately jump to their feet as well to look out through the window with the same expression that was etched on Kameda's face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They weren't the only ones. At this point, many of the Yin spirits in the izakaya restaurant had spotted the peculiar scene taking place outside, and they had all risen to their feet with alarmed expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sea of gold had appeared on the horizon!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's not the sea...\" Kameda quickly rushed over to the window, then gulped nervously as he said, \"Those are ships!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yin spirits in the restaurant became quite curious upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, they weren't nervous, nor were they scared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Peace had reigned over the world for so long that no one could've anticipated that a war would be suddenly coming. As such, they were more curious than fearful about where these ships had come from.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are the ships from Tsushima Island?\" A drunk Yin spirit rushed out of the door with a slightly red hue to the netherfire in his eyes. Many Yin spirits had already gathered at the railing outside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who knows?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Surely Tsushima Island doesn't have that many ships!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The number doesn't seem quite right...

As a seasoned sailor, Kameda recognized a problem: since when did the navy have such large ships?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though he still couldn't see them very clearly, he had spent over 100 years as a sailor, and he was willing to bet on all of his experience that every single one of these ships was far larger than the navy's warships!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These weren't ships from the Nipponese Underworld, so where had they come from?!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Upon making that realization, he was instantly jerked out of his drunken state before turning around and running away without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was an ancient lighthouse on the coast of Nagasaki, and despite its age, it was still in use.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If his memory served him correctly, that lighthouse was home to the largest telescope in Sasebo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He rushed all the way to the top of the lighthouse, and sure enough, there was the telescope.

The Cathayan Underworld had declared war upon the Nipponese Underworld! But how was that possible?!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Everyone!\" He leaned over the railing of the lighthouse as he yelled with all his might, \"Run!

Right at this moment, all of the chains lit up in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were Yin runes!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, the chains began to shorten rapidly like arms that were frantically pulling the ships toward the coast of Sasebo, and in the blink of an eye, the entire fleet's speed doubled as all of the ships lunged forward at an alarming pace!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Deathly silence.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, a wave of screams erupted from the netherworldly citizens gathered on the coastline, and they all rushed back toward the city like the receding tide!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Run!

Instead, they were constructed in the form of ironclad beasts with battering rams for horns!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the bow of the ship at the forefront of the fleet stood Zhou Yu holding a large flag, and he yelled with all his might, \"Fire!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beside his ship was a row of ironclad ships, and atop each of the ships was a statue of a Vermilion Bird that was over 30 meters tall with a wingspan in excess of 70 meters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These A-grade weapons of war, Vermillion Bird Feathers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that order issued by Zhou Yu, all of the Vermillion Bird statues slowly spread open their wings like phoenixes preparing to soar up into the heavens, and countless specks of fiery red light began to glow. Two seconds later, countless crimson netherfire arrows shot forth through the air like a swarm of locusts, covering a distance of several kilometers to reach the coastline in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire surface of the sea was illuminated bright red as the netherfire incinerated everything in its wake, and in the blink of an eye, the entire coastline of Sasebo had already been transformed into a sea of fire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thud...&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the peak of the tallest mountain in Sasebo was a Shinto shrine, and inside the shrine was a divine official in a tall black hat.

There were far too many of them to count, and they were all enormous!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They concealed the sea and devoured the heavens, speeding along from the Strait of Tsushima, and the Cathayan Underworld flags that they bore were extremely eye-catching.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was far too formidable an army for Sasebo to be able to combat!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He tried to stand back up, but his legs were too weak to hold his weight, thereby preventing him from rising to his feet. Even though he was unable to stand up, he was still frantically inspecting the entire city, which had been plunged into chaos. He looked on as all of the netherworldly citizens of the city frantically rushed up the mountain, because the Shinto shrine at the summit of the mountain was the only place where they could possibly seek refuge and protection.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, he turned around before rushing toward the back of the shrine like a madman.

Takeshigerō was the Mitsubishi Corporation's first restaurant, so Iwasaki Yatarō viewed it in very high regard, which was why it had been replicated in the underworld as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A stack of banknotes were placed on the table. Looking out from here, one had a clear view of the vast Tokyo Bay. At this moment, a series of fortress-like pavilions had risen up over the surface of the water, and standing in front of Iwasaki Kyōya was a man in an official's robe. The man was tapping the center of his own palm with his closed hand fan, looking on with an intrigued expression as Iwasaki Kyōya extended a respectful bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The man picked up his teacup before casually taking a sip. \"As I'm sure you're already aware, the Cathayan Underworld launched a surprise attack on Nagasaki an hour ago, and at the moment, Sasebo and the islands of Ukushima, Nakadori, Fukae, and Hirado have all already fallen. Mistress Izanami has already issued an order to seal off all waterways and land routes, so you're putting me in a very difficult position here.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a fawning smile on Iwasaki Kyōya's wizened face as he said, \"Kobayashi-san, we wouldn't want to do things this way either if it weren't for the fact that our clients are urging us to deliver their goods to Hokkaido. This is the first large order our Mitsubishi Consortium has ever received, and we have to fulfill it no matter what!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The man heaved a faint sigh as his brows furrowed slightly. \"It's not that I don't want to help you. The problem is that all of the checkpoints in the waterways are being overseen by the daimyos, so how am I supposed to help you?\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"All you need to do is sign a clearance notice, and we'll take care of the rest.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The man remained silent and offered no response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">Iwasaki Kyōya</span> <span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">lowered his head again, and on this occasion, he picked up a black suitcase before placing it onto the table. The suitcase was then opened to reveal orderly stacks of underworld currency.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I know that this isn't much money considering the size and number of our ships, but this is already the largest amount of cash that our Mitsubishi Consortium is capable of mustering up at this point. Please grant us your assistance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya extended a deep bow until his forehead was almost in contact with the table, and after a few seconds of silence, the man finally conceded, \"Alright, but I'm only making this exception just this once.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\" Iwasaki Kyōya immediately extended another respectful bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Sometimes, I think I'm a little too nice,\" the man said with a smile, but his smile then immediately faded as he continued, \"I can sign the clearance notice, but the cargo of all of your ships must be inspected.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya was just about to raise his head again, but he kept it lowered, and even though a cold look had appeared in his eyes, his voice remained as respectful as ever. \"Surely there's no need for that. The Mitsubishi Consortium isn't the Mitsubishi Corporation of the mortal realm, and we're only transporting normal cargo.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Those are the rules,\" the man replied in an implacable voice. \"We are in times of war. There's no way that the Cathayan Underworld's army will be able to reach all the way here, but this is still a matter that has to be taken very seriously. If I don't examine your cargo, I won't be able to answer to my higher-ups.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a few seconds did Iwasaki Kyōya heave a faint sigh. \"I see. In that case, there's no helping it.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sense of foreboding suddenly welled up in the man's heart, yet before he even had a chance to stand up, Iwasaki Kyōya abruptly stood up straight and plunged a dagger into the man's chest like lightning with both hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The man's expression immediately became twisted with shock and agony, and he stared intently at the dagger protruding out of his chest. His mouth slowly sprang open as if he wanted to say something, but his soul disintegrated into netherfire before he had a chance to say anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, the door of the room was opened, and several armored warriors stormed in. The leader of the group took a glance at the scene before him, then asked, \"Has it been taken care of?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Iwasaki Kyōya was still in the same pose as before. He had struck with incredible ruthlessness and precision, but at this moment, his hands were trembling and bulging with veins.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's alright, the first time killing someone is always the hardest,\" the man said. \"We don't have any time to waste, Iwasaki-san. Everyone's lives are on the line here! Have you taken care of things or not?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's done.\" Iwasaki Kyōya's hands were still trembling as he put the dagger away, then picked up an official notice from the table. \"Torii<span style=\"; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">-s</span>an, please get your people to allow the Mitsubishi Consortium's ships free passage right away. The ships will immediately travel to Aokigahara to welcome the troops of the Cathayan Underworld!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An hour after the landing at Nagasaki, Maeda Toshiie's tenshu pavilion had become the scene of a horrific slaughter. Maeda Toshiie had invited the commanders of the Nipponese Underworld's army in this region under the guise of wishing to discuss countermeasures against the Cathayan Underworld's invasion. During the meeting, he had slain them all and cleared away the first barricade leading to Aokigahara.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mōri Terumoto's tenshu pavilion was situated in Brightmoon City, and the 50,000 Yin soldiers under his command vanquished the local forces with karmic flame arrows to open up the second barricade.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In addition to that, the tenshu pavilions of Kobayakawa Takakage, Ukita Hideie, and Tokugawa Ieyasu had all become sites of bloodshed. They had been planning in secret for years, and they were acting with extreme stealth and caution. Those at Amano-Iwato were completely oblivious to the fact that their defensive efforts were being undone from the inside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"A new era is coming.\" At the top of the tenshu pavilion, Tokugawa Ieyasu was holding tightly onto his hand fan as he looked at the Sanzu River under the moonlight. The river was flowing peacefully past his tenshu pavilion. It was over a kilometer wide and had no end in sight, stretching all the way from Aokigahara straight into the Nippon Sea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amanozako, it's about time that you made a move!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In one more hour at most, the Cathayan Underworld's army of 200,000 was going to enter from the mortal realm through Aokigahara, then travel to the Nippon Sea through the Sanzu River to attack from Hokkaido.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once the army of the Nipponese Underworld and the four million Kunitsukami gathered at Kansai and Chubu, the final battle would commence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He spread his arms open and closed his eyes as he felt the wind blow against his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Come! Let us see who will have the last laugh!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a smoke signal was lit at the foot of the tenshu pavilion, and the flame illuminated countless cavaliers, footsoldiers, and artillery troops.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their eyes were all glowing with determination and battle intent, and the netherfire inside them was like a galaxy of stars clustered around the tenshu pavilion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nagasaki.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The largest city in Nagasaki, Sasebo, had fallen, and directly neighboring the city were the towns of Hasami and Sechibaru. Thanks to the activation of the inter-realm mirrors, the cavalry of the Cathayan Underworld was temporarily kept at bay, but the atmosphere in those towns was still extremely tense.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to the existence of the inter-realm mirrors and the limited number of Yin spirits that could enter through them at a time, the Nipponese Underworld was extremely difficult to invade, but much easier to defend. It was exactly because of this that the structure of the nation's military was decentralized, and the number of Yin soldiers directly under the underworld's command was no more than 200,000. The backbone of the military were the yokai and the four million Kunitsukami.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The father of the four million Kunitsukami was Susanoo-no-Mikoto, so in the Nipponese Underworld, Susanoo-no-Mikoto was the supreme figure in the military, while Izanami was able to rule with her superior cultivation rank.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the Kunitsukami didn't have any set areas where they dwelled. Even yokai had to be worshiped, and worship came from humans. Hence, most of the yokai were in the mortal realm. Even though they had already been notified of the situation as quickly as possible, it would still take them at least two to three hours to get to the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a result, the two towns were waiting extremely anxiously, and even the slightest of pin drops would be audibly heard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the border between Hasami and Sasebo, 50,000 Yin soldiers from the Nipponese Underworld were already gathered and prepared for battle. In front of them was a row of at least dozens of inter-realm mirrors. In other words, the Cathayan Underworld would only be able to send through a maximum of several hundred troops at a time, and they would be met by an army of 50,000.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The footsoldiers were standing at the forefront with their spears raised, and behind them were the archers and artillery soldiers. On either side of the army were the cavalry units, and there was an armor-clad general standing atop the tall platform at the center, waiting with a fierce look in his eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The atmosphere was extremely tense. They knew that the army of the Cathayan Underworld was on the other side of the inter-realm mirrors. The two sides were separated by nothing more than the inter-realm mirrors, and they couldn't see one another, but they could clearly sense the frosty killing intent coming from the other side.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ashikaga Yoshiaki's hand was resting on the hilt of his katana, and his chest was heaving violently as he stood atop the tall platform. A strong gust of wind blew past, causing all of the nearby flags to flap audibly. The tense and oppressive silence was enough to drive one insane.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unbeknownst to everyone, beneath the visor of his helmet, his teeth were tightly clenched, and he was waiting with bated breath for all hell to break loose.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a Yin soldier quickly rushed over to his side, then whispered something into his ear, and he gnashed his teeth together forcefully. \"Alright, you can go now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The daimyos were refusing to follow their orders, despite the dire nature of the situation!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had accepted Izanami's edict, but they were making up all types of excuses to buy time for themselves, leaving Ashikaga Yoshiaki on the front lines to face the Cathayan Underworld's army alone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How can they still be playing mind games at a time like this? Do they not know how serious the situation is?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as he was fuming internally, a burst of loud rumbling suddenly rang out from behind him, immediately following which a vast expanse of powerful Yin energy erupted across the entire space.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ashikaga Yoshiaki faltered slightly upon seeing this, then immediately swiveled around with an ecstatic expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind them were eight massive teleportation arrays, each of which was over 1,000 meters in size. A sea of dense Yin energy had appeared above one of the arrays, forming an enormous cloud of darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The cloud was divided up into tiers, and it was slowly expanding in all directions. Within the Yin clouds, hundreds of thousands of specks of crimson netherfire were burning in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the base of this enormous pillar of Yin energy was a woman in a red kimono with her head cocked to the side. Her hair flowed down in all directions like black silk before vanishing into the Yin clouds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She was dressed in a very elegant fashion, but her mouth was split open all the way to her ears. From the back, one would be able to see that the back of her kimono was drooping down slightly to reveal her smooth back, and there was another face on her back, a crimson ghostly face!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This woman was Futakuchi-onna, a yokai of Shikoku.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The reinforcements from the Kunitsukami have arrived!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ashikaga Yoshiaki heaved a long sigh of relief, and right as he was about to say something, vast Yin energy erupted out of six of the teleportation arrays in unison, surrounding the entire town of Hasami in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One scarlet eye sprang open, followed by a second one, then a third... All of a sudden, thousands of scarlet eyes had appeared within the darkness!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Kunitskukami had descended upon the battlefield!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The war was about to begin, and both sides were already raring to go.</span></p>"

In the blink of an eye, over 100 torii gates had emerged in front of the inter-realm mirrors!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as the spears of golden light crashed into the torii gates, they were significantly slowed down as if they had flown into a pool of treacle, and ripples were spreading through the air. All of a sudden, the tips of the spears began to glow brighter and brighter, and the golden flowers opened up further and further.

The Kunitsukami were completely incapable of comprehending signals, and as a result, the Yin soldiers at the front were retreating, while the yokai at the back were rushing forward, and the two were getting in each other's way. Ashikaga Yoshiaki could feel his own skin crawling at the sight of the pandemonium unfolding before him!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time seemed to have slowed down, and he felt as if he could hear a countdown timer to destruction ticking down beside his ears. He even raised his hands in a powerless fashion as if he wanted to grab ahold of something, only to put them down again in a defeated manner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, he felt as if his world had become impossibly bleak, and his mind was completely blank.

A river of golden light exploded between the torii gates and inter-realm mirrors, and all of the nearby Kunitsukami were inundated by the golden light amid anguished screams. As for everyone else, they could only look on helplessly as the light advanced toward them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Boundless light filled heaven and earth, sweeping over the ground with devastating power. All of the torii gates collapsed amid violent rumbling, and the earth was instantly torn apart by the resulting shockwaves before being reduced to dust by the all-devouring light. In the end, the resulting dust was swept up by the waves of wind to form walls of dust that were hundreds of meters tall before sweeping in all directions alongside the violent storm of light.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Futakuchi-onna faltered slightly upon seeing this, then immediately laid herself flat against the ground without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several of the yokai around her drew a sharp breath in unison before fleeing for their lives.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless Godslayer Spears flew through the inter-realm mirrors like giant arrows, and the entire town of Hasami was quaking in the face of their formidable might.

Countless Godslayer Spears had exploded at the same time just now, and the resulting power was beginning to resemble that of a forbidden art. As a result, he was unable to remain on his feet and had flattened himself against the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The golden light slowly dissipated, revealing the entire area to have been severely ravaged.

This was a movement that he had rehearsed countless times, and it had already become second nature to him. In the face of the oncoming cavaliers, he readied his spear with his wrists and arms before piercing it forward as forcefully as he could.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several dozen spears were plunged forward in unison beside him, piercing through the air toward the fearless cavalier.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, in the instant that the spears made contact with the cavalier's armor, they discovered that their spears had been stopped cold in their tracks!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of gentle black and white light rose up, and a string of loud clangs rang out, but the spears were unable to pierce through the cavalier's armor.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the top-tier military formation of the Cathayan Underworld, the Wumu military formation definitely wasn't something that the Yin soldiers of a third-rate underworld could contend with!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The veins on the arms and foreheads of the Nipponese Yin soldiers were bulging as they strained every sinew of their bodies to drive their spears forward, but a sense of despair and powerlessness was quickly taking root in their hearts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Is this the power of one of the four pillars?

After the first row of foot soldiers was vanquished, the cavaliers swarmed upon the remaining foot soldiers with their longswords brandished. They were building up more and more momentum as their warhorses galloped along, and they harbored no fear whatsoever toward the spears directed at them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were willing to use their own lives to open up a path for their comrades!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taking advantage of this window of opportunity before the Nipponese Underworld's forces had recovered their formation, they were going to charge as far as possible!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After several waves of spear strikes, the defenses of the Wumu military formation were finally pierced through, and the first line of heavy cavalry units were reduced to specks of netherfire that rose up into the heavens. However, all of the foot soldiers discovered that at this point, these cavaliers had already forced them back by around a meter!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though they had just been severely ravaged by the explosions from those A-grade weapons of war, this was still an army of hundreds of thousands, yet they had been forced back by a meter by just several hundred cavaliers!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, this was only the beginning.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before the first wave of cavaliers had concluded their charge, the next wave of several hundred cavaliers had already emerged to follow them, and they plunged viciously into the ranks of the Nipponese Underworld's troops.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nipponese Underworld's forces were still in disarray, and they were forced back several more meters by this ferocious charge!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The cavaliers were greatly encouraged by this, and they pulled out the large shields from behind them. The surface of the shields was riddled with hooked barbs, and with the shields held up in front of them, the cavaliers continued to charge onward with unwavering determination.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Stop them! Stop them!\" Ashikaga Yoshiaki felt as if he were about to go insane. Never did he think that the flaws of a decentralized military system would be exposed so severely. From his vantage point, he could clearly see that the group of just several hundred cavaliers had managed to charge over 10 meters through the Nipponese Underworld's ranks!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ground that they had gained on the Nipponese Underworld's army was like a nightmarish gash that couldn't be closed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, before the Nipponese Underworld's Yin soldiers had a chance to assemble, more and more cavaliers emerged in waves.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the short span of less than 20 minutes, the Nipponese Underworld's army was comprehensively crushed. The fearless cavaliers of the Cathayan Underworld had managed to force back the enemy by over 50 meters, and countless Nipponese Underworld Yin soldiers were being trampled to death by the second!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, the fourth and fifth waves of cavaliers were completely different from their predecessors.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of them were wearing suits of armor that were riddled with hooked spikes, and they were riding giant skeletal warhorses that were burning with scorching flames.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The warhorses raised their heads and neighed toward the heavens, crashing around in a chaotic and frenzied fashion.

Whenever they thought of the fact that on the other side was the Cathayan Underworld, which had once withstood an invasion from seven nations, they would be struck by a sense of fear, yet also a hint of excitement.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were fearful of the enemies, but also relishing the opportunity to face such a formidable foe.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the evil ghosts were staring intently at the inter-realm mirrors in front of them, and their claws and fangs had all been bared as they readied themselves to tear apart any enemies that stepped through the mirrors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">40 minutes passed by, then 50. Even after an hour, none of the Yin spirits had relaxed in the slightest. As time passed, they only became more and more wary. Everyone knew that the longer the enemy took, the more ferocious their attack was going to be. During the past hour, several more groups of yokai reinforcements had arrived on the scene.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was 1 AM.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The forces at Hasami were led by Yamata no Orochi and Ashikaga Yoshiaki, with 970,000 Kunitsukami among their ranks, including Futakuchi-onna, Akaname, Inugami, Yamawaro, and Yamabiko, and they were responsible for guarding the inter-realm mirrors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meanwhile, the forces at Sechibaru were led by Ibaraki-dōji, with 860,000 Kunitsukami among their ranks, including Aosaginohi, Shiranui, and Mikoshi-nyūdō. All of the evil ghosts were enveloped in a sea of Yin energy, and they were prepared to guard the route to Shikoku with their lives.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At 1:30 AM, cracks suddenly appeared on the inter-realm mirrors in Hasami and Sechibaru.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The cracking sound wasn't very loud, but it instantly drew the attention of all of the yokai.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They're coming!

As the cracks grew larger and larger, the evil ghosts became more and more tensed up. Futakuchi-onna was already crouched down like a leopard about to pounce, while all of the fur on Inugami's body was standing up on end as it grabbed onto the hilt of its katana.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meanwhile, all of the other evil ghosts were also making preparatory gestures, whether conscious or not, and they were all waiting for the moment that the enemy forces emerged through the inter-realm mirrors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A loud crack rang out as all of the inter-realm mirrors up ahead shattered in unison, and at the same time, Ashikaga Yoshiaki drew his katana as he roared with all his might, \"Defend our soil!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Charge!\" Yamata no Orochi also roared with all eight of its giant heads, and in the next instant, the entire earth trembled violently as all of the yokai charged toward the inter-realm mirrors with unstoppable might, vowing to overwhelm the army of the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, no troops of the Cathayan Underworld emerged to meet them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The dreaded cavalry units of the Cathayan Underworld failed to show up. Instead, what appeared was a series of mechanical oxen.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The army of mechanical beasts wasn't just limited to oxen, it encompassed all of the 12 zodiacs!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Beneath the hooves of the oxen were countless mice that were rapidly scurrying toward the army of yokai, and they were followed by dragons, horses, sheep... All of a sudden, an enormous army of mechanical beasts had emerged.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What the hell is this?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ashikaga Yoshiaki and Yamata no Orochi were both staring at the mechanical beasts with perplexed expressions, and out of caution, all of the yokai ceased their advance before the entire army retreated. There were even several yokai that tried attacking the mechanical beasts with magical arts, but they were unable to gather any information aside from the fact that the mechanical beasts had extremely resolute exteriors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, their raging battle intent subsided, and Yamata no Orochi looked on at the mechanical beasts with a wary expression before commanding, \"Get back!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as its voice trailed off, bursts of piercing red light began to radiate out of the joints of all of the mechanical beasts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ashikaga Yoshiaki drew a sharp breath as a name instantly flashed through his mind, following which he frantically waved his hand fan as he yelled, \"Retreat! Retreat! Get away from there!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, a thought occurred to him, and his voice abruptly trailed off.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He thought of the countless mice that had rushed into their army, and his hands were trembling at the thought.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The mice had a very pleasant name, which was Lotus Forest.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, despite their beautiful name, they were actually moving Yin energy bombs!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were always deployed in large numbers, and when they exploded, they resembled blooming scarlet lotus flowers, hence the name of Lotus Forest. These were A-grade weapons of war that hadn't been seen in centuries!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Was the Cathayan Underworld really planning to destroy the Nipponese Underworld?!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this perilous situation, there was no time to think about such things. As his order was issued, all of the Yin soldiers were already quickly beginning to retreat, but the backbone of the Nipponese Underworld's forces wasn't its Yin soldiers. Instead, it was the Kunitsukami.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Kunitsukami mostly resided in the mortal realm, so they hadn't undergone much centralized military training. In fact, they were unable to even comprehend many of the flag signals. Thus, once the flag signals for retreat were raised, the retreating Yin soldiers immediately clashed with the Kunitsukami, who had no idea what to do, and the formation of the entire army was quickly plunged into complete chaos.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, a string of earth-shattering explosions erupted.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Powerful shockwaves swept through the entire town of Hasami, and countless scarlet lotus flowers bloomed on the ground, instantly inundating the army of yokai.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Taking advantage of the chaos and panic, the larger mechanical beasts abruptly accelerated and charged directly toward the areas where the most yokai and enemy Yin soldiers were gathered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yamata no Orochi's mouths sprang wide open as if it wanted to say something, but was unable to utter even a single word.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who could've anticipated that the leading force of the Cathayan Underworld would consist of machines of war? Without having to expend a single soldier, they had already plunged the entire army of Kunitsukami into complete disarray!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">More and more mechanical beasts rushed into the Nipponese Underworld's army, followed by more devastating explosions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One scarlet lotus flower bloomed after another, some of which were over 10 meters tall, while others only reached around a meter in height. It was a breathtakingly beautiful sight to behold, yet Ashikaga Yoshiaki and Yamata no Orochi felt as if their hearts had been plunged into glacial pits.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless specks of netherfire rose up into the heavens in the wake of the explosions, and all Yamata no Orochi could do was helplessly yell for their troops to hold their formation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The more powerful yokai were able to survive the explosions, but most of the wandering spirits and weaker yokai had already been erased from existence by the wave of devastating explosions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, the sound of a long horn rang out from the other side of the inter-realm mirrors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Fire!\" An emotionless command was issued, and a series of black spots rapidly drew closer and closer within the frames of the mirrors. Soon, they were presented clearly before all of the yokai, revealing them to be countless black spears.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The spears looked as if they had been fired from arcuballistas, and they were traveling at an alarming speed, sweeping up gusts of fierce wind behind them. Their shafts were golden in color, while their tips opened up layer upon layer to form golden lotus flowers, each with&nbsp;a speck of golden netherfire at the center.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were A-grade weapons of war, Godslayer Spears!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Bursts of dazzling golden light erupted throughout the entirety of Hasami!</span></p>"

Nagasaki and Fukuoka were already frantically gathering their troops, preparing to defend their land against enemy attacks.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Sasebo was quickly razed to the ground under the hooves of the Cathayan Underworld's cavalry, but Qin Changxin didn't stop there. The army was like an unstoppable wave, charging toward the nearby counties along the main roads.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Blitzkrieg tactics had been adopted here, and given the abrupt nature of the assault, and the crushing advantage the Cathayan Underworld's army had in terms of military formations, Qin Changxin's plan was to ride this wave and conquer as much of the Nipponese Underworld as possible in one fell swoop.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, right as the lights of the next county appeared in the distance, all of the cavaliers tugged on their reins in unison, and the entire army drew to an abrupt halt amid a string of raucous neighs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin's eyes narrowed slightly as he looked up ahead. In front of each Yin soldier was a mirror that was around 10 meters tall and roughly five meters wide. No matter where they tried to go, the mirrors remained directly in front of them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were inter-realm mirrors, and it was undoubtedly the case that enemy Yin soldiers were already rapidly gathering on the other side of the mirrors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nipponese Underworld had reacted very quickly, and it was forcing the Cathayan Underworld's army to face the full brunt of the enemy forces through the use of these inter-realm mirrors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was clearly not the time to be charging ahead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The troops on the ships still hadn't landed yet, and scant preparations had been made. With that in mind, Qin Changxin swiveled around on his horse and ordered, \"Let's go back!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, several cavaliers rushed toward Qin Changxin before cupping their fists in respectful salutes. \"General Qin, we have received news of resounding victories on the islands of Ukushima, Nakadori, Fukae, and Hirado.

With those islands under their control, no matter how arduous the invasion turned out to be, it was at least ensured that there was no way the Nipponese Underworld would be able to launch a counterattack.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Good!\" Qin Changxin replied with a nod. \"Instruct all of the troops to assemble at the four islands, and we'll be holding a meeting between all of the high-ranking military officials right away!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">………………………………………………..</span>&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of wooden clogs on floorboards rang out along the entire corridor as a Yin spirit hurried forward, panting heavily as he did so.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In front of him was a tall mountain, and there were two shimenawa ropes tied around the entire mountain. The mountain appeared to be over 1,000 meters tall, and it was impossible to calculate its area. A series of timber paths were erected from the ground, leading to all parts of the mountain like stairs to heaven.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The paths were constructed in a very intricate fashion, and each one was over 20 meters wide, with torii gates positioned at 100-meter intervals. As the paths rose up higher and higher, the torii gates also followed that trend, and at the highest point, the torii gates were close to 1,000 meters tall!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On either side of the path above the torii gates were countless white lanterns, and there was a giant cave that had been dug onto the mountain peak, within which was a massive rock.

Her black hair was gently drifting above her, and she was wearing a pristine white kimono. She looked up with a cold expression as he said, \"If denouncing the Cathayan Underworld could resolve this issue, then I would be glad to join you, but if it can't do that, then I suggest you stop wasting time and actually do something useful!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her gaze swept over everyone like a pair of daggers as she continued, \"Even with the inter-realm mirrors at our disposal, it'll be very difficult for us to ward off the Cathayan Underworld's invasion given the massive disparity between our military formations. I'd say that we'll only be able to last a maximum of six hours, and this is the final period of time we'll have in which to save ourselves! This is the most shameless invasion to have taken place in the last century!

Even though we don't want to admit it, if the Cathayan Underworld is determined to destroy our nation, we'll only be able to last one or two years at most. The only possible way that we can be saved is to receive international reinforcements before our nation falls! So long as Amano-Iwato doesn't fall, our Nipponese Underworld will have a chance at making a recovery!

At the very most, they'll only be able to put up some resistance in Kyushu.

Both sides were fighting on instinct and adrenaline, and on the chaotic battlefield, everyone failed to notice that no more heavy cavalry units were entering through the mirror frames.

Due to a heart attack, he had entered the underworld 10 years ago. At this moment, he stood up in an unhurried manner, then said, \"You claim that this is an invasion, but I beg to differ. The Cathayan Underworld has already issued many warnings to the Nipponese Underworld for its unannounced trespassing of Cathayan waters, but we didn't receive any response, and that's why we had to take military action to protect the honor of our nation.

Once that happened, it would be able to venture into the Pacific Ocean as it pleased, and no underworld would be able to stop them.

We are the only ones on this plane capable of looking out into space, and we are willing to release the blueprint for the super telescope to the entire world!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is that true?!\" Hela abruptly rose to her feet with an excited look on her face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Space exploration was an unprecedented feat in the underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The dominance that the four pillars held over this plane was something that could no longer be altered, but space exploration would entail a brand new beginning!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course!\" Qin Ye replied in an implacable voice. \"The Cathayan Underworld has never and will never go back on its promises!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I'm happy to provide the blueprint, but you'll have to come up with the skull of a Yama-King yourselves!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire hall quickly erupted into discussion, and Qin Ye made a quieting gesture to silence everyone before continuing, \"On top of that, the Cathayan Underworld will be displaying our latest space exploration technology to the entire world during the war to recover the province of Nippon. Our flying shuttles are already able to approach Limbo, and all that's left is to break through the planar walls!

Claiming air supremacy is only one thing, the true trump card lies in what he can and is going to do with this air supremacy!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the main stage, Qin Ye gave all of the death gods present a nod, then concluded, \"That's the end of resolution 0000, and all of the aforementioned clauses will come into effect once the matters regarding the province of Nippon draw to a conclusion. Chief Secretary Anador, we can begin the vote now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes.\" As the chief secretary of the Coalition of Underworlds, Anador was naturally aware of just how significant Qin Ye's statement had been. She heaved an internal wistful sigh for the Nipponese Underworld, then made her way onto the stage in an expressionless manner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She swept her gaze across all of the death gods present, then declared, \"We will now begin the vote on whether the Coalition of Underworlds should intervene in the war between the Cathayan Underworld and the Nipponese Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face as he watched the unfolding proceedings. He was confident that no one would continue to stand by the Nipponese Underworld following the reduction of the energy resource costs, the opening of the Cathayan Underworld's market, and the release of its space exploration data!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Farewell, Izanami!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Those who approve of military intervention on the war between the two underworlds, please raise your hand.

He had a feeling that all of the underworlds would be reluctant to vote in favor of military intervention, but never did he think that not a single underworld would be willing to stand up for the Nipponese Underworld during the final vote!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were simply accepting the notion that the Nipponese Underworld had always been a rightful part of the Cathayan Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was both amused and a little saddened by this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the end of the day, power was still paramount in this world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of the massive energy resource cost reductions, the prospect of securing a slice of the massive pie that was the Cathayan Underworld's market, and the glorious future that would be tapped into by space exploration technology, why would anyone care about the survival of an underworld that didn't even have a single death god?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thank you for your understanding, everyone.\" He rose to his feet with a smile, then said, \"Also, I prepared a special present for everyone.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a wave of his hand, a massive LED screen slowly descended from above the main stage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"In five days, the Cathayan Underworld's latest space exploration achievements will be displayed here alongside a grand fireworks display, so please stay tuned.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The screen was depicting the war-ravaged Nipponese Underworld.</span></p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Fierce karmic flames swept over Hokkaido, and looking out from Umi no Maru, one could only see a sea of bright red.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Umi no Maru was the tenshu pavilion of the Matsumae Clan in the underworld. As a daimyo clan that hadn't been affected during the Sengoku period in the mortal realm, it had continued to maintain a neutral existence even after entering the underworld. As a result, it didn't take part in the conflict between the daimyos and the gods and demons. Thus, Umi no Maru was expanded further and further over time, and at this point, it was virtually taking up the entire central region of Hokkaido.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tall city walls had been erected on either side of Umi no Maru, and they were entirely constructed from the D-grade material, Spirit Devouring Crystal. The city walls extended as far as the eyes could see, and they gave off a warped, semi-transparent black presentation, much like obsidian. The city walls cut off all paths from Umi no Maru to the southern part of Hokkaido, and the inter-realm mirrors were no more than 10 meters away from the city walls, so cavaliers were unable to charge through the mirrors and siege weapons couldn't be completely erected. As a result, it was known as the northern great wall of the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The reason why Umi no Maru was so resolute was because Hokkaido neighbored the Cathayan Underworld and the Russian Underworld. In the face of one of the four pillars and a first-rate underworld, the Nipponese Underworld had no choice but to erect the sturdiest of fortresses here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was already 4 AM, but Umi no Maru was still brightly lit and bustling with activity.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Down below, countless warhorses and foot soldiers had already assembled, and flags bearing the Matsumae Clan's emblem were flapping in the wind. Over 100,000 yokai and Yin soldiers had gathered in Umi no Maru, and they were all looking on with wary expressions beyond the mountain.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several hours ago, the Cathayan Underworld's Yin soldiers had descended upon Sōya-misaki, Wakkanai, and the Shiretoko Peninsula, seemingly out of nowhere, arriving at over 10 different points on the coastline of Hokkaido.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Three hours ago, Lake Kussharo was conquered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Two hours ago, Lake Mashū and Lake Akan were conquered in rapid succession.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The latest report had come an hour ago, bearing news of the fall of Daisetsuzan.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld's forces were unstoppable!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nipponese Underworld's Yin soldiers and yokai were completely unprepared, and they were no match for the formidable Cathayan army. Even Tamamo-no-Mae had gone to reinforce Chugoku and Shikoku, and no one could've anticipated that the Cathayan Underworld would be attacking from both coasts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the yokai in the tenshu pavilion had assembled, and soldiers bearing reports were constantly coming and going. Even the most ordinary of servants could sense the tension in the air, and they didn't even dare to breathe too loudly in fear of drawing attention to themselves. In the face of the Cathayan Underworld's forces, the entirety of Umi no Maru had become eerily silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Onmoraki's teeth were tightly gritted as he slammed the latest report onto the table. \"We can't retreat any further than this! The entire northern half of Hokkaido has already fallen, yet the Cathayan Underworld's troops are still advancing! They're not just seeking to conquer Hokkaido, they want to go even further beyond that and invade the rest of the nation!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wanyūdō transformed into a menacing face in mid-air as it said, \"If Hokkaido falls, then the Cathayan Underworld's army will seize control over the Tsugaru Straits, which is a natural barricade. If the Cathayan Underworld doesn't return that territory to us, we'll never be able to stage a successful retaliation! If Umi no Maru is lost, then that would be the equivalent of Hokkaido being lost, and our deaths will be inevitable regardless of whether we flee or not. Our best chance now is to rely on Umi no Maru as a fortress. At the very least, we have to last until Mistress Izanami's orders arrive!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We won't be able to defend Umi or Maru on our own,\" Bake-kujira said in a grim voice. \"The Matsumae Clan...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Matsumae Clan will defend Hokkaido with our lives!\" Before Bake-kujira had a chance to finish, the door was abruptly opened, following which Kakizaki Suehiro entered the room in a full suit of armor with a katana strapped to his waist. Behind him were Matsumae Yoshihiro and Kakizaki Mitsuhiro, both of which were also fully equipped with armor.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind them was a samurai in a suit of red armor, but what was different about him was that instead of the fukikaeshi flaps that were customarily present on samurai helmets, his helmet had a swathe of white fur.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This suit of armor was extremely distinctive and renowned, to the point that all of the gods and demons of the Nipponese Underworld were aware of who it belonged to. In the blink of an eye, several underworld emissaries raised their heads with stunned expressions. \"Is that Takeda Shingen?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Following their surprise came the elation!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Chubu and Kansai had deployed their troops!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Reinforcements had arrived!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They weren't reinforcements from the faction of gods and demons, but Takeda Shingen was a vastly renowned daimyo of the Sengoku period! Even in the underworld, the Takeda Clan was a formidable force to be reckoned with. With their assistance, Umi no Maru would at least be able to last longer than it otherwise would.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Takeda-san...\" Onmoraki made his way over to Takeda Shingen with an excited expression, yet before he had even arrived, he was greeted by a flashing blade.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Kakizaki Suehiro, Matsumae Yoshihiro, Kakizaki Mitsuhiro, and Takeda Shingen had drawn their blades in unison. Onmoraki's elated expression was still frozen on its face as its body abruptly disintegrated into Yin energy and netherfire.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Deathly silence.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was such an abrupt turn of events that Wanyūdō was rooted to the spot for three seconds before turning around and fleeing for its life. \"Takeda Shingen is a traitor!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were a total of six underworld emissaries in the hall, and they frantically rushed toward the doors. However, in the instant that the doors were opened, they were greeted by the sight of countless foot soldiers standing outside.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were foot soldiers that served the daimyos.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless weapons were aimed toward the hall, and as soon as the underworld emissaries rushed out, they were met by a ruthless assault, which was the last thing that they saw before entering the cycle of reincarnation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In that instant, they suddenly understood many things.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why had the daimyos arrived in full suits of armor? How had the fleets of the Cathayan Underworld arrived at Hokkaido without any warning? Why was it that the Cathayan Underworld's forces were attacking Umi no Maru when it was one of the most resolute fortresses in the entirety of the Nipponese Underworld?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant right before their demise, they were all blessed by the gift of hindsight, allowing them to see everything clearly, but unfortunately for them, they wouldn't be able to tell anyone what they had just figured out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Seize the city!\" Takeda Shingen commanded without any hesitation. \"Seize Umi no Maru and open the city gates!

Each one was over 100 meters in length, and there were countless Yin soldiers stationed on them, ready for battle. Furthermore, the sides of all of the ships were lined with hooked spikes and cannons.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were over 100 ships in total in the fleet, and what was most peculiar about the ships was that they were all of a pure golden color. All of the fleets that they encountered along the way immediately parted to let them through. Everyone knew that this was the Golden Fleet, which reigned supreme in the Mediterranean Sea!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Golden Fleet had arrived, and Erinys was also present. That wasn't even to mention the smaller ships at the center of the Golden Fleet. There were roughly 200 of these ships, and they were entirely black in color. Furthermore, their design was quite strange, with figureheads depicting creatures with female human upper bodies and serpentine tails. This was the vastly renowned Naga Fleet of the Hindustani Underworld, and no one dared to get in the way of these two formidable fleets.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The main ship of the Golden Fleet, the Hades, was situated at the very center.

Erinys had received an order from Hypnos, instructing her to travel to the Nipponese Underworld as quickly as possible, and at the moment, the Spratly Islands were directly ahead of them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was already a part of the Cathayan Underworld's waters, and Erinys set down her binoculars as she commanded in a thunderous voice that was audible across the entire fleet, \"All units, report your positions!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One report after another immediately arrived, and no abnormalities were reported. However, not only was Erinys not relieved to hear this, her brows furrowed even further.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was clearly something wrong here!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was an easy task for the Cathayan Underworld to take down the Nipponese Underworld. The most difficult part of all of this was contending with the Coalition of Underworlds. With that in mind, she was already prepared to engage the Cathayan Underworld's navy in battle in the South Cathay Sea, but no enemy troops had been stationed here at all!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Could this be an oversight from the Cathayan Underworld's King Yanluo?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys was not convinced of that. She had met the third King Yanluo on several occasions, so she knew just how sly and cunning he was. There was no way that he would fail to realize who his true opposition was during this invasion of the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"All ships are to continue to remain on high alert!\" she ordered. \"If any abnormalities are discovered, you have permission to open fire right away without having to wait for my orders!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the fleet encountered no resistance whatsoever as it passed by the Spratly Islands, the Two Groups Islands, and even the Scarborough Shoal and the Zhongsha Islands!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had already entered the Cathayan Underworld's inland sea, and going any further beyond this point would take them to Formosa!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys was becoming more and more tensed up by the second. The entire fleet had slowed down significantly, and right at this moment, an enormous pillar of water suddenly erupted out of the surface of the sea up ahead.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Immediately thereafter, a series of giant tentacles emerged from the waves like ascending dragons, sending a boundless storm of rainwater crashing down from above. Within the storm was a massive, inky black island that was rising up from the depths of the sea!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It's here!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys's heart immediately leaped into her throat, and she had already identified the emerging island as the Cathayan Underworld's marine fortress, the Kraken!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of the Abyssal Prefects beside her immediately asked, \"What do we do? Do we attack?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was by far the most enormous fortress they had ever encountered on the sea, and it was capable of completely destroying their fleet just by crashing into it!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, the Golden Fleet and the Naga Fleet wouldn't just sit there and allow the Kraken to wreak havoc as it pleased. If the two fleets were that vulnerable, then there would've been no need for the Kraken to be deployed to intercept them. The fact that the Kraken had appeared here was already an indication that Qin Ye was taking them very seriously.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Kraken has emerged quite far away, so it looks like they don't want a direct confrontation.\" Erinys cast a grim gaze toward the horizon, where countless specks of netherfire had already lit up on the black island that was the Kraken.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Those were Yin spirit cannons, indicating that the Kraken was prepared for battle, and that any ships that approached it would be met with an indiscriminate attack from the Cathayan Underworld's navy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Stop here,\" Erinys ordered. \"They're issuing us a warning. I'm sure they'll be sending underworld emissaries to speak to us soon. The Coalition of Underworlds still hasn't arrived at a decision yet, and if we're too aggressive in our attack, we'll be swept up into this war as well. If two of the four pillars get involved, then this could easily escalate into a world war, and the consequences of that would be dire.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The captain was silent for a moment before asking, \"So you're saying we should stop here and wait for a decision from the Coalition of Underworlds?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys turned and made her way toward the ship's cabin with her cape flapping behind her like a gorgeous flower in the night.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course.

To compound the Nipponese Underworld's woes even further, Yamata-no-Orochi had gone into slumber beneath Amano-Iwato, and there was no way that it would be able to recover from its injuries without at least several centuries of rest.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shuten-d<span style=\"; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">ō</span>ji continued in a despairing voice, \"Close to two million Kunitsukami were comprehensively defeated by less than 200,000 Cathayan troops...

However, even if they were to defend the inter-realm mirrors at all costs, the outcome wouldn't be much different. The Cathayan Underworld's strategy was very clear: they were going to send mechanical weapons of war to wreak havoc among the Nipponese Underworld's forces, then deploy troops through the inter-realm mirrors to buy time for the Harken to descend.

It was no exaggeration to say that it was like a lethal force of nature, as destructive as it was inevitable. In other words, if they wanted to defend the inter-realm mirrors, they would have to dedicate massive numbers of troops to oppose the Cathayan Underworld's forces, but it would all be futile anyway once the Harken arrived on the scene.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In abandoning the inter-realm mirrors, the Nipponese Underworld was giving up its only advantage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this situation, it seemed that no strategy was viable for the Nipponese Underworld.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't because the Cathayan Underworld had a vast array of tactics that it could employ, there was simply an overwhelming disparity in power that made all strategy and tactics meaningless.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are we just going to give up on Shikoku and Chugoku?\" Shuten-d<span style=\"; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-; float: none; display: inline !important\">ō</span>ji asked through gritted teeth. \"That's my territory!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We can't make any more concessions!\" Izanami declared with a serious expression. \"We can't allow the Cathayan Underworld's forces to advance any further...

Before the Coalition of Underworlds agrees to send reinforcements, we must fight tooth and nail for any inch of territory that we can!

This was the worst possible news! Hokkaido was the northernmost prefecture of the Nipponese Underworld, and it had never been heavily guarded. In order to ward off the Cathayan Underworld's troops, most of the Kunitsukami were already on their way to Chugoku and Shikoku.

Even if submarines were used, they would still have to contend with the inter-realm mirrors! Our waters are currently filled with inter-realm mirrors, how were the daimyos unable to muster up any resistance?\" Tamamo-no-Mae asked. \"With Hokkaido's defenses, there definitely would've been enough time to at least get the word out!

At the same time, those traitors had opened up a path between the mortal realm and the underworld! There was no way that these Yin soldiers had come from the underworld as everything around the sea had been under their constant surveillance ever since the beginning of the war!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who was it that had opened the shimenawa between the mortal realm and the underworld?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who was it that had allowed the Cathayan Underworld's forces to access Tokyo Bay?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami's lips were pursed so tightly that the color had completely faded from them. \"Amanozako, you shameless bitch!

Susanoo-no-Mikoto!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm here,\" Susanoo-no-Mikoto replied with a bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Take 150,000 Kunitsukami and travel to Tokyo right away to decimate all of the daimyos and seal Amanozako's shimenawa!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\" Susanoo-no-Mikoto departed as a gust of Yin wind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though it was already too little too late, it was still better than doing nothing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'll go as well.\" Tamamo-no-Mae stood up after taking a moment to calm herself down. \"I have to return to Hokkaido right away.

Under normal circumstances, perhaps it would've taken the Cathayan Underworld's army as long as a year to break through the inter-realm mirrors, but with the two Yama-Kings among their ranks, the entirety of the Nipponese Underworld would be conquered within a week!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, they could only rely on external aid.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami rose to her feet as she said in a cold voice, \"Contact all of the underworlds right away!

What happened to their super long distance teleportation arrays? You may not have interacted with the four pillars much, but I'm sure that you know that all of the four pillars are trying to recruit as many allied nations as possible so they can set up super long distance teleportation arrays in those nations. For example, the Cathayan Underworld has super long distance teleportation arrays in the Hanyang Underworld and all of its subsidiary nations. Our Nipponese Underworld also has those things! 1,000 Yin soldiers can be sent through the Aegyptian Underworld's super long distance teleportation array on Mount Fuji at a time, so why is that only two fleets are coming right now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as her voice trailed off, she picked up a remote control to switch on an LED screen, which was displaying Erinys with a grim look on her face. \"Mistress Izanami, the Golden Fleet was projected to arrive in Nagasaki in a day, but our fleet and the Naga Fleet have encountered resistance from the Kraken.

Have you thought about what's up there in the north? There are the Northern Europa nations, which are close allies with the Cathayan Underworld.

Both cups of tea were left untouched as Izanami asked with a grim expression, \"How many troops do we have left?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We still have 3.25 million Kunitsukami left, and all of the daimyos across the nation can muster up an army of around 500,000 to 600,000 troops,\" Susanoo-no-Mikoto replied. \"What are you planning to do?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He already had a feeling about what the answer to his question was going to be.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The topography of the Nipponese Underworld was downright terrible. The nation was surrounded by the sea, and there were countless avenues through which enemy troops could advance. If the Cathayan Underworld were to deploy its troops from Hokkaido, they would be able to quickly conquer the Kanto region.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were a total of six prefectures in Kanto, including Saitama, Yamanashi, and Chiba, and it also had a very special administrative area, which was Tokyo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Further resistance was clearly no longer an option. During the past few days, the Kunitsukami had been absolutely decimated. Only at the very beginning of the war did the Nipponese Underworld's forces manage to muster up some effective resistance, but after that, their confidence and morale had been razed to the ground by the Cathayan Underworld's army.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no way that such a despondent and hapless army could defend anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this situation, Susanoo-no-Mikoto knew that their best bet would be to gather all of their remaining troops in Kansai, forming a triangular stronghold consisting of Hyogo, Osaka, and Kyoto. The more they spread their troops, the quicker the defeats would come, and morale would only plummet even further as a result.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In other words, they had to make preparations to abandon Tokyo at any moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, that was the capital city of Nippon in the mortal realm! Even in the underworld, Tokyo was a city that ranked alongside Kyoto. It was a super city with close to 100 million netherworldly citizens, and if they were to abandon it, that would be akin to an admission that the Nipponese Underworld had given up all hope.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could raise this idea, but he couldn't make the decision.

Do you still not understand? Many of the cities invaded by the Cathayan Underworld's forces already had their gates wide open by the time they made it through the inter-realm mirrors!

Erinys's brows were tightly furrowed as she cursed in a low voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Is the situation already so terrible that they've already activated Minakanushi?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meanwhile, all of the death gods were gathered in a conference hall in the headquarters of the Coalition of Underworlds, watching the unfolding scene on the Nippon Sea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Whoosh!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A burst of pure white light erupted into the heavens, and within the light, an antiquated longsword was revolving while slowly ascending. Countless specks of light were raining down from it, giving it a holy and ethereal appearance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was one of the Nipponese Underworld's three divine artifacts, Kusanagi no Tsurugi.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sword rose up to the highest point in the sky, sending its radiance spilling down all over the entirety of the Nipponese Underworld. Thin veils of white light descended from above like rays of the sun, and Anko closed her eyes as she heaved a wistful sigh. \"So it was activated after all... I'm sorry, but your demise was sealed from the very beginning.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone looked on in silence at the prelude before the demise of a civilization. Right as Kusanagi no Tsurugi rose up into the sky, a pillar of silver light suddenly erupted from each of the Nipponese Underworld's eight regions. It was as if they were resonating with Kusanagi no Tsurugi, and that entire area of the sea began to sway violently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Turbulent waves rose up one after another, forming powerful shockwaves that swept up tsunamis rising up to several dozen meters in height.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanatos, Anubis, and Yamaraja turned toward Qin Ye in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Half an hour ago, all of the ruler death gods had received notification from the Cathayan Underworld to gather in this conference hall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"><em>Is this what he wanted to show us?&nbsp;</em></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The activation of the creation-grade divine artifact was a clear sign that the Nipponese Underworld had already backed into a corner, and the invasion had only commenced several days ago. Was the Cathayan Underworld trying to show off its power through this?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, in order to completely conquer the Nipponese Underworld, the Cathayan Underworld would still have to deal with many other powers. Defeating Izanami alone didn't mean that they had defeated the current governing party. Without at least several months, it would be impossible to truly take down the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, how was this worthy of showing off at all?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye seemed to have gleaned their thoughts, and he said, \"Patience, my friends. Just keep watching, I guarantee you won't regret it.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the pillars of light rose up from the eight regions of the Nipponese Underworld, eight pieces of crimson magatama began to rise up, and they ascended higher and higher. As they did so, they became brighter and brighter, forming a crimson necklace around Kusanagi no Tsurugi.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was Yasakani no Magatama!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After Yasakani no Magatama rose up into the sky, slight tremors ran through the entire Nippon Sea, following which countless bursts of light rose up into the heavens from beneath the surface like reverse waterfalls of light. Directly above the sword and the magatama, a mirror that was several thousand square kilometers in area began to take shape.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Yata no Kagami!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The mirror was surrounded by an enormous vortex of clouds with arcs of azure lightning flashing through it, forming a spectacular sight of indescribable majesty to behold. All of the underworld emissaries who witnessed the spectacle could only marvel at what they were seeing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that the three divine artifacts completely emerged, a vast expanse of white light swept over the entire Nippon Sea, following which a katana appeared in mid-air. The katana was tens of thousands of meters in size, and it was completely formed by scintillating radiance!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Minakanushi, the creation-grade divine artifact of the Nipponese Underworld had been completely activated!</span></p>"

Please meet back here in two hours. For now, meeting adjourned!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, she hurriedly left the venue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't say anything as he calmly walked down from the stage. Right as he was passing by the ruler death gods of the three pillars, Yamaraja suddenly said, \"Given how severely depleted the Cathayan Underworld is, don't you think you're biting off more than you can chew by attacking the Nipponese Underworld at a time like this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a glance at him, then cast his gaze toward Thanatos and Anubis as a smile suddenly appeared on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Biting off more than we can chew? I think you're under the false assumption that taking down the Nipponese Underworld poses a challenge to us. It just so happens that I have a present for all of you that will be revealed in a few days, and you'll understand everything then. For now, please exercise some patience.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that, he departed from the hall, but none of the three ruler death gods left. Thanatos turned to the other two with a smile as he said, \"Looks like unwavering confidence is a trait shared by all rulers of the Cathayan Underworld. It just so happens to be the perfect time for breakfast. Would you care to join me?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The construction of the headquarters for the Coalition of Underworlds was funded by all nations, and it was complete with all types of facilities, including breakfast restaurants of all types of national cuisines.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The restaurants reserved for the ruler death gods of the four pillars were naturally different from those catering to other death gods. The three ruler death gods soon found themselves in a resplendent hall with bodyguards stationed outside. There were fake mountains and streams, as well as all types of exotic plants in the hall, and as soon as the three ruler death gods sat down, gentle piano music immediately began to play.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A delectable breakfast was quickly brought to them on beautiful platters one dish after another, and the fragrance of milk, coffee, and freshly baked bread instantly wafted throughout the entire hall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thinking back now, we really should've seen this coming,\" Thanatos murmured as he took a sip of coffee. \"Prior to opening up the island of Formosa as an outpost, most of the Cathayan Underworld's trade with the rest of the world was conducted in the form of exchanges of goods, rather than transactions involving currency. There's no way that a normal underworld would've done that.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Anubis clearly had a preference for dairy products, and he raised a cup of milk to his lips with a black paw, then said, \"However, no one suspected a thing just because the Cathayan Underworld is one of the four pillars. Cognitive inertia really is a terrifying thing...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's not important,\" Yamaraja said as he set down his cup of black tea. \"There's no point in thinking about missed opportunities and crying over spilled milk. The Array of the Nine Gods prevented us from doing anything to the Cathayan Underworld anyway. What we have to discuss now is what we're going to do next.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanatos downed his coffee in one go, then set the empty cup down onto the table. A server quickly took the empty cup away before replacing it with a gold-rimmed crystal cup, which was filled with fragrant green tea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Surely he's not revealing all of this just because we can't break through the Array of the Nine Gods. It's imperative for the Cathayan Underworld to maintain its status and reputation, and those aren't things that can be protected by the Array of the Nine Gods.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yamaraja shook his head in response. \"If that was his logic, then he would've already revealed this long ago.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So why is he only telling everyone this now?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I don't know,\" Yamaraja replied with an absentminded expression. \"However, I'm almost certain that he definitely has something up his sleeve.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Perhaps we can try to probe out exactly what he has up his sleeve,\" Thanatos suggested.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The other two ruler death gods' expressions changed slightly upon hearing this. In a rare moment of unity, the three ruler death gods had come together.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanatos picked up a small piece of cake before placing it into his own mouth in an elegant manner. \"Erinys's Golden Fleet is currently locked in a confrontation with the Kraken.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This statement was met by a few seconds of silence, following which Anubis asked, \"Are you of the opinion that the Cathayan Underworld's current navy isn't powerful enough to oppose the Golden Fleet? If that's the case, then we can get the Golden Fleet to launch the first attack under the guise of protesting the invasion of the Nipponese Underworld, and that could force the Cathayan Underworld to reveal its trump card early.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the Nipponese Underworld was already completely inconsequential, at least in their eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All they were interested in was how they could exploit the situation with the Nipponese Underworld to achieve their objectives, no one actually cared about the Nipponese Underworld itself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who had risen up in opposition back when the Argosian Underworld had conquered most of Europa and the Aegyptian Underworld had conquered the Middle East?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the second King Yanluo had turned a blind eye to all of that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If one of the four pillars were determined to get something, there would be no way to stop them. Thus, seeing as opposing the invasion would be futile anyway, it would be far more beneficial for them to think about how they could use this invasion to their advantage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanatos nodded with a smile, then dismissed all of the nearby servants with a wave of his hand. At the same time, a Judge-level underworld emissary silently approached him before extending a respectful bow. \"What are your instructions?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanatos turned to the underworld emissary with his eyes slightly narrowed, then said, \"Send a message to Erinys right away instructing her to be more aggressive and confrontational with her words and actions. Ultimately, the goal is to find an excuse to open fire on the Kraken.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The netherfire in the underworld emissary's eyes flickered slightly upon hearing this, following which he lowered his head in response. \"As you wish.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">……………………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the Hades of the Golden Fleet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys set down the receiver with her brows slightly furrowed, unable to comprehend why Thanatos would issue her such an order.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She cast her gaze toward the distant horizon, where the Kraken sat on the surface of the sea like an insurmountable island, cutting off the entire waterway. Even the mighty Golden Fleet would struggle to deal with the consequences of attacking such a monstrosity, and she couldn't help but wonder what Thanatos was thinking.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, it was her duty to follow orders, so she would still do as she was told.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She returned to the cabin, where all of the high-ranking officials on the ship were already awaiting orders. She took a brief moment to gather her thoughts, then instructed, \"Connect me to the Kraken...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, her voice abruptly trailed off as she cast an incredulous gaze forward. Furthermore, she wasn't the only one; all of the underworld emissaries in the cabin were also stunned by what they were seeing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a small boat in an antiquated Cathayan style, and there were two boatmen paddling the vessel as it slowly emerged from the Kraken, then casually made its way toward the formidable Golden Fleet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">One of the generals on the Hades looked on with tightly furrowed brows, unable to quite comprehend what he was witnessing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The boat moved forward slowly yet steadily, and five minutes later, Erinys's expression suddenly changed slightly as she took a deep breath. \"Prepare to welcome the Yama-King of the Cathayan Underworld!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A Yama-King of the Cathayan Underworld?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone turned toward her with incredulous expressions, and she explained, \"We are on the sea right now, and there are countless powerful beasts in the sea, yet not a single one has dared to attack that boat! What do you think that entails?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone was immediately enlightened upon hearing this, and they quickly departed to make preparations. However, Erinys remained still on the spot, continuing to stare intently at the approaching boat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The boat was extremely peculiar.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just as she had said, not a single Yin beast dared to appear near the boat, as if there were some type of terrifying monster on it. However, what was most perplexing to her was that she was unable to sense any Yin energy at all coming from the boat!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This meant that there was either really no Yin energy on the boat, or there was a being on the boat that was so far beyond her that she couldn't even sense their Yin energy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the boat drew closer and closer, the sense of pressure in the air grew more and more oppressive. She was holding onto the railing in front of her with a white-knuckled grip, and she felt as if she were witnessing a boundless abyss slowly making its way toward her over the sea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, her secretary quickly approached her. \"All preparations are complete... Mistress Erinys?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys was still staring intently at the approaching boat, which was no more than two kilometers away from the forefront of the Golden Fleet at this point.

Minakanushi, which had taken on the form of the giant katana in the sky, continued to give off brilliant radiance.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside the conference hall, all eyes were on Qin Ye as the other ruler death gods waited to see what he was going to do next.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone knew that Qin Ye had to possess an extremely powerful trump card, given that he was comfortable with sharing the current state of the Cathayan Underworld under these circumstances, and Minakanushi was going to be the litmus test for this trump card.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Soon, everyone was going to witness just how powerful this trump card was.

Soon, all of the other death gods had also seen it, and they involuntarily leaned forward slightly as they tightened their grip around their armrests.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">High up in the sky above Minakanushi, a black dot had appeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was extremely tiny.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of the pure white world created by Minakanushi, it appeared to be nothing more than a tiny needle, but Minakanushi wasn't displaying any reaction to it at all!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How could this be?\" Anko clasped a hand over her own mouth as a stunned look appeared on her face. She then turned her gaze toward Qin Ye with a hint of fear and wariness in her eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mythic Spirit Black Mamba was also staring at the black dot with a completely flabbergasted expression, and he finally understood what had given Qin Ye the confidence to reveal everything to the world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">None of the death gods present were able to remain calm at this moment. They had all failed to fully comprehend the significance of a prior statement that Qin Ye had made, which was that the Cathayan Underworld had made large strides in the field of space exploration, developing flying shuttles that could already approach Limbo. That announcement had seemed completely insignificant compared with everything else he had declared, but only now was its significance dawning on everyone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld's flying shuttles were capable of approaching Limbo and avoiding the detection of Minakanushi. This meant that the Cathayan Underworld's flight equipment could transcend beyond all arrays and national protective arrays!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"All national protective arrays have a flight restriction element to them,\" Yamaraja mused as he turned to Qin Ye with narrowed eyes. \"Upon entering a foreign nation's territory or territorial sea, everything will immediately be impacted by their national protective array. However, your flying shuttles can set off from your nation before flying over to other nations, and the flight restriction won't be triggered due to the&nbsp;altitude, is that correct?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">So this is the true significance behind the Cathayan Underworld's flying shuttles approaching the planar walls?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Essentially, the airspace of the entire underworld was under the Cathayan Underworld's surveillance, and no beings aside from Yama-Kings would be able to reach sufficiently high altitudes to intercept their flight equipment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yanluo Qin, I think we should immediately reinforce the specific international laws related to airspace,\" the nameless god of death said in a cold voice. \"Even if you've agreed to share this technology with everyone, before other nations have had a chance to develop it, I think such technology should be banned from usage.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Rest assured, our flying shuttles will only remain within the Cathayan Underworld,\" Qin Ye replied in an indifferent voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A string of faint sighs of relief instantly rang out across the hall, and Qin Ye cast a meaningful glance toward all of the ruler death gods present before lowering his gaze.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How naive they were!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Forbidden arts were banned from usage, so perhaps they were of the opinion that the flying shuttles would be stopped by national protective arrays, even if they were carrying siege weaponry. On top of that, all of the major underworlds had at least a death god or two, so they were confident that they would be able to deal with these flying shuttles if required.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, what they had failed to realize was that the weapon hanging from the flying shuttle was something they had never seen before.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the black dot swayed slightly, and a figure emerged out of thin air. As soon as the figure appeared, they plummeted straight down from the sky without any hesitation, plunging down like a meteorite from altitudes of thousands of meters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Arthis.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She was wearing an inky-black robe, giving her the appearance of a death god descending from the heavens. Due to the extreme speed of her descent, scorching golden flames had appeared all around her, and these flames were swept up by the fierce wind resistance to form long threads of fire, much like the tailfeathers of a fiery phoenix of death.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Boundless Yin energy was surging around her entire body, and the juxtaposition of black and gold presented a stark contrast. Her purple hair was flapping in the wind behind her, and she was carrying a massive claymore on her back.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that she began to descend, Minakanushi finally sprang into action.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The eight pieces of magatama suddenly lit up on the katana, and a blood-red eye sprang open on each magatama. The eight eyes were fixed firmly on Arthis, and on the other side of the katana, countless scenes depicting the long history of the Nipponese Underworld were rapidly flashing past one after another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What is she doing?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Anubis gently stroked his own chin as he watched Arthis with a grim and perplexed expression. All of the ruler death gods present were aware that she was the Cathayan Underworld's latest Yama-King, but there was no way that a single Yama-King would be able to break through Minakanushi.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All creation-grade divine artifacts were extremely powerful entities, and Yama-Kings could contend directly against them, but it was exceedingly difficult for Yama-Kings to be able to break through them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Is this supposed to be the Cathayan Underworld's trump card?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He turned to Qin Ye with a puzzled expression, wondering how this could've possibly been considered as a trump card.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't the only one with these thoughts. On the screen, slight tremors ran through Minakanushi, immediately following which a burst of dazzling light swept over the entire screen.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this instant, all Yin spirits in Asia were able to see the burst of scintillating light erupting over the sky in the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It sliced through the heavens, extending for thousands of kilometers. In the next instant, it split apart down the center, and powerful shockwaves were sent sweeping in either direction. At the same time, a flurry of light swept through the pure white world formed by Minakanushi like countless pristine butterflies, presenting a breathtakingly beautiful sight to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if the very heavens had truly been sliced open!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, at the same time, Arthis also began to move.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She drew the claymore that had been resting on her back, and in this instant, a thought suddenly occurred to the ruler death gods of the three pillars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their mouths sprang open in unison, and they abruptly rose to their feet as they stared intently at the screen.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yamaraja could see countless Yin runes lighting up layer upon layer on the surface of the claymore, and it was as if it were resonating with heaven and earth. With the claymore in her hand, all of the white radiance around her that had been released by Minakanushi suddenly began to twist and warp violently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a clash between two bursts of power, one of which had sliced the heavens apart, while the other was sewing it back together. The entire conference hall had fallen deathly silent. The incandescent white light rising up from down below was met by the violently warping space around Arthis, and it seemed that their clash was going to devour the entire world.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even for those watching from the Coalition of Underworlds far, far away, chills were sent running down their spines. A sense of powerlessness and certain destruction welled up in their hearts, and countless armrests were crushed into dust in this instant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, they weren't the ones directly facing all of this. Witnessing this devastating spectacle in person was completely different from seeing it through screens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Golden Fleet was situated in the South Cathay Sea, and at this moment, it was being ravaged by a ferocious windstorm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys's hair and clothes were flapping wildly behind her, as were all of the flags on the Hades. She had involuntarily lowered her center of gravity slightly as she looked on at the clash that was about to take place above the Nipponese Underworld, and she opened her mouth several times, but found herself unable to utter even a single word.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even for her, this was the first time she had ever seen a creation-grade divine artifact completely unleashed. However, for some reason, there was a sense of fear in her heart that refused to die down, and her mind was telling her that this fear didn't stem from Minakanushi.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who could it be?

She could sense that the Yama-King in the sky wasn't particularly powerful.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, Arthis took a deep breath. The claymore in her grasp had already completely transformed into a sword of light, and she raised it high above her own head before plunging it down with ferocious might.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In this instant, the fear in Erinys's heart swelled to a peak.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Amid the prelude of devastation, she was able to catch a clear glimpse of the sword.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had split up into sections, but all of the sections were positioned in a neat and orderly fashion. All of the fragments were carrying extremely complex Yin runes that were glowing like celestial bodies. If the light of Minakanushi were the sun, then these fragments would be a galaxy of stars that was outshining even the sun itself!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">BOOM!!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Devastating shockwaves erupted in all directions, sweeping up gargantuan tsunamis, and the surface of the sea instantly exploded.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Erinys's skin was crawling as she frantically yelled, \"Get down! This is a forbidden...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire Golden Fleet was inundated by boundless radiance before she had a chance to finish her sentence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She felt as if she were situated at the very center of the Big Bang, and it was as if her body were being torn apart before being reassembled over and over again. She gritted her teeth tightly as she was completely overcome by fear, and the only question in her mind was why this forbidden art was so much more powerful than its counterparts!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Internally, she was screaming with all her might, and even though she was a mighty Yama-King, she couldn't even keep her eyes open. This was most likely what it felt like for an ant to be swept up in a tornado. All she could do was instinctively grab onto the railing before her as tightly as she could, and that was the only thing keeping her from being flung away like a leaf in a storm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second-generation forbidden art had been unleashed!</span></p>"

If news of this were to be released, there would undoubtedly be countless netherworldly citizens across the underworld denouncing Qin Ye as a dictator and a desecrator of civilizations, but at the very least, no one here dared to speak against him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld's ability to airdrop forbidden arts was a threat that no nations were able to defend against, and in light of that, everyone wisely chose to remain silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the end, the Golden Fleet and the Naga Fleet remained berthed in the South Cathay Sea this entire time, not daring to advance any further.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ultimately, none of the underworlds dared to stand up for the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one said anything, not even the ruler death gods of the three pillars. Wherever Qin Ye's gaze landed, the ruler death god under his scrutiny would reflexively avert their gaze. A faint smile appeared on his face as he declared, \"In an hour from now, the Cathayan Underworld's army will reach Kyoto and announce the conclusion of this diplomatic dispute.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the death gods in the hall took a silent glance at Qin Ye, fighting back the countless insults that they wanted to hurl at him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had just razed an entire nation to the ground, yet he was playing it off as a diplomatic dispute.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye paid no heed to the resentful eyes aimed at him. He had always been known for his shamelessness, and that was certainly holding him in good stead here as well.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"If no one would like to say anything, then I'll be going on ahead,\" he continued as he rose to his feet. \"As for the discussion surrounding the new weapon, my representatives will facilitate the discussion.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, he departed while all of the other ruler death gods looked on in silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after over 10 minutes had passed did the ruler death gods of the three pillars stand up before also departing in silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as Thanatos arrived at the entrance of the conference hall, he took a glance back at the hall's lavish interior. His gaze roamed over the intricately crafted statues, the masterful oil paintings, the resplendent chandeliers, then finally came to a rest on the four sets of tables and chairs at the forefront.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These four sets of tables and chairs carried a pronounced Cathayan, Hindustani, Argosian, and Aegyptian style. They didn't appear to be all that remarkable, but every single piece of wood used to craft them was extremely expensive, and taking a seat on the red pads of the chairs was an experience so heavenly that it could make one moan out loud.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These were the seats reserved for the four pillars, the superpowers that reigned supreme at the top of the underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He knew that the Cathayan Underworld's hold on its status as one of the four pillars had never been that strong. It had nothing to do with the power of the nation, the problem was its isolation. A nation that was completely cut off from the rest of the world simply couldn't be expected to lead the rest of the world effectively.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There had been widespread speculation with regard to the reasons behind the Cathayan Underworld's self-inflicted isolation. However, after Qin Ye voluntarily divulged the information that everyone had been dying to hear, and all of the death gods were contemplating taking advantage of the situation, the Cathayan Underworld had made a display of absolute power that granted it the strongest hold it had over its status as one of the four pillars for the past century.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From this point onward, no one would ever think about knocking them down from their throne again</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He turned and departed as he heaved a faint sigh to himself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By the time Qin Ye reappeared, it was already several hours later.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had arrived in a massive tenshu pavilion, within which countless daimyos had gathered. Tokugawa Ieyasu was standing at the center of the group of daimyos, and in the instant that everyone caught sight of Qin Ye, they immediately bowed to welcome his arrival. Among them, Amanozako's massive figure was particularly eye-catching.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Greetings, everyone,\" Qin Ye smiled as he said. \"I know that all of you are concerned about your fiefdoms. I made a promise to all of you, and I fully intend to keep it. Qin Changxin will be responsible for taking care of everything. I'm sure all of you are already familiar with him, so I won't make any introductions. Is General Yue up there?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was clear that Qin Ye was in no mood to be seeing these daimyos at the moment, and Tokugawa Ieyasu immediately caught onto that as he smiled and replied, \"Of course. General Yue has always been here. Prior to the arrival of the forbidden art, Master Harken and Mistress Arthis had already rescued General Yue. The situation was very urgent at the time, and the forbidden art fell right after that, so Izanami didn't have time to do anything.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was just about to depart when he paused momentarily, then turned to Tokugawa Ieyasu with a meaningful smile. \"It's not a forbidden art, its name is Death God.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Ah yes, please pardon my inaccurate use of words,\" Tokugawa Ieyasu immediately replied with a bow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Using a forbidden art went directly against the treaty on the non-proliferation of forbidden arts. As for Death God, it was a new weapon, and strictly speaking, it wasn't a forbidden art.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded with a smile, then made his way directly toward the teleportation array, followed by a large group of secretaries, assistants, and bodyguards.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a tidy and simple room on the top floor of the tenshu pavilion. Qin Ye instructed his entourage to remain at the entrance of the staircase, then opened the intricately constructed sliding door alone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The door was gently opened to reveal an elegant Nipponese-style hall, and beside the table at the center of the room sat a figure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was wearing a long robe, but it could still be clearly seen that his right shoulder was missing. In the instant that Qin Ye strode into the room, the figure immediately stood up before extending a respectful bow. \"Yue Fei pays his respects to Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No need for formalities.\" Qin Ye was fighting to suppress the excitement in his heart. This was a man revered by virtually all Cathayans. He wasn't particularly tall or handsome, and his skin was rather coarse. In fact, it could even be said that he was completely unremarkable, but this man had led an epic life that had given rise to countless legendary tales.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, his life was one of tragedy, and it was perhaps because of this that he was easier to sympathize with as the heroic protagonist of the tales of his life.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Throughout all of history, there had only been six Wumus, namely Li Guangbi, Ma Yin, Gao Huaide, Cao Wei, Liu Qi, and Yue Fei.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Sorry to make you wait so long,\" Qin Ye sighed as he grabbed onto Yue Fei's hand. \"I'm embarrassed to think that it took us several hundred years to rescue you.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yue Fei cupped his fist in a salute as he replied, \"There's no need to apologize, Yanluo Qin. I feel extremely honored and fortunate that you made this effort to rescue me at all.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye released Yue Fei's hand with a smile before withdrawing his own hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was unexpectedly calm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps he was so tranquil and calm because he had already been waiting for this moment for so long. Furthermore, he couldn't help but feel as if there were something missing about Yue Fei.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he had to pinpoint what that particular thing was, he would say Yue Fei was missing the heroic aura that he expected him to possess.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Despite this, his expression betrayed nothing as he sat down onto the main seat, then crossed his legs as he picked up his teacup in a graceful manner before taking a sip, following which he asked, \"What happened to your right shoulder?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This is because of the Nipponese Underworld's blood maggot curse,\" Yue Fei replied in a calm manner. \"No one knows where it came from, and Izanami isn't the true master of the Nipponese Underworld. After she entered the Nipponese Underworld, she ate the food of the underworld, and that was how she became afflicted by the blood maggot curse, forcing her to remain here as the ruler of the Nipponese Underworld. Prior to her arrival here, someone had already created this underworld. Izanami went to great lengths to capture my soul as she discovered that devouring the spiritual body of high-grade emissaries of the Cathayan Underworld can alleviate the symptoms of the curse.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yue Fei cocked his head to the side and gently stroked his missing shoulder as he continued, \"Having already served as food for her for several centuries, I am but a crippled man with nothing to offer. I heard that our Cathayan Underworld collapsed a century ago. May I ask if the six paths of reincarnation have been restored?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye lowered his head upon hearing this. He finally realized what Yue Fei was missing now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was drive and purpose.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He felt himself to be useless baggage, that he wasn't worth being rescued by the Cathayan Underworld. Perhaps he even felt guilty and ashamed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, Qin Ye stroked his teacup as he heaved a forlorn sigh.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You want to enter the cycle of reincarnation?\" Qin Ye asked. \"You do realize that after you're reincarnated, you'll lose your memories from this lifetime, so you'll no longer be yourself. You were willing to serve the first King Yanluo and the second King Yanluo, so why can't you serve me as well?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's not that I don't want...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Yue Fei had a chance to finish, Qin Ye raised a hand to cut him off, then looked directly into his eyes as he asked, \"A missing shoulder is nothing. Let me ask you just one thing: if your spiritual body is still whole, would you be willing to serve Hell?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yue Fei immediately rose to his feet without any hesitation, then fell to one knee as he replied, \"I would want nothing more than to remain as your loyal subordinate and serve Hell with the entirety of my heart and soul!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A surprised look appeared on Qin Ye's face upon hearing the decisive tone in Yue Fei's voice. In this instant, it was as if he had sprung back to life.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His chest was heaving slightly, and even though there was nothing physically remarkable about him, he was suddenly exuding an extraordinary aura.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the abyss of despair, he had been shown a glimmer of hope, and that was more than enough to ignite the ambition and fighting spirit that had laid dormant in his heart for centuries.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the Wumu that Qin Ye wanted. Prior to this, he had even wondered whether the historical records had exaggerated Yue Fei's exploits, whether the current Yue Fei was still even worthy of receiving the inner demon's soul. After all, the inner demon's soul was a completely unique artifact in this world, so he had to be extremely careful with who he decided to give the soul to.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he was certain about what the right decision was now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The old Yue Fei had never disappeared, it had merely been suppressed. His heart and spirit had been buried under a veil of despondence and shame, and he didn't want Hell to waste any more time with him just because he had been a heroic figure during his lifetime. At the same time, he didn't want to live out the rest of his existence in the underworld as a cripple, so he chose to be reborn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after Qin Ye told him that his missing shoulder wasn't worthy of concern did the Yue Fei of old return with a vengeance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye stood up as he made a grabbing motion, and countless high-grade Yin runes emerged in mid-air, following which a ball of rainbow-colored light&nbsp;appeared above his palm, gently revolving on the spot.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An aura beyond the Yama-King level slowly spread through the room, and even Yue Fei was barely able to repress his elation upon sensing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For the first time in several hundred years, his cursed shoulder was feeling itchy, and that was only from the smell alone!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if the flesh there were striving to grow back like countless seedlings fighting to burrow out of the soil.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Eat it,\" Qin Ye instructed as he pushed the ball of light slowly toward Yue Fei, and the latter immediately grabbed it before swallowing it without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the next instant, a burst of enormous Yin energy exploded throughout the tenshu pavilion before sweeping in all directions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A Yama-King was about to be born!</span></p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the mortal realm, Cathay was perhaps the nation that harbored the most animosity toward Nippon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During World War 2, the Cathayan Underworld managed to ward off the Nipponese forces after a herculean struggle. At the time, Cathay had been at its weakest and most vulnerable state in a very long time, and Nippon's soldiers had swept through the entire nation. If it weren't for the valiant resistance mustered up by the people of Cathay, things would've been far different from what they were in the present day.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had only been several decades since that war, and many of Cathay's older generation still remembered those hardships. In addition to that, Nippon had never been sincere in its apology and frequently paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine, so even in the newer generations, many of Cathay's citizens were still very discontent with Nippon.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, no one would've ever been able to imagine that Cathay would be able to conquer Nippon in the underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not long ago, there had been widespread controversy surrounding the Nipponese Underworld, and countless netherworldly citizens of the Cathayan Underworld were urging the central government to attack. However, there was no clear verdict as to whether troops had been deployed as Hell had released no official reports on the matter. However, all of the Yin spirits of Ashmound knew that several dozen warships and hundreds of thousands of Yin soldiers had recently set off for the Hanyang Underworld. Some theorized that it was for a military drill, while others speculated that the troops had been deployed to patrol the sea. Very few of them were actually convinced that this was the beginning of an invasion against the Nipponese Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, it had only been a few days, and the Nipponese Underworld had already announced their unconditional surrender!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside a certain restaurant, all of the patrons were staring at the television screen with stunned expressions, and many pairs of chopsticks had already dropped along onto the floor. They were listening to Izanami's unconditional surrender declaration with their mouths gaped wide open, looking as if they were primary school students listening to a lecture on quantum physics.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"... I hereby declare that the Nipponese Underworld and all of the armed forces in the Nipponese Underworld will be surrendering unconditionally to the Cathayan Underworld...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They surrendered? Hold on, we actually invaded the Nipponese Underworld? This isn't a hoax, is it?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After 15 minutes, the unconditional surrender declaration drew to a conclusion, and all of the Yin spirits in the restaurant looked at one another with blank expressions, feeling as if they were in a dream.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With the arrival of a new era of peace, it had seemed like the Cathayan Underworld would never be able to exact its revenge on the Nipponese Underworld for what Nippon had done in the mortal realm. However, revenge had apparently just been exacted without any warning!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire restaurant was silent for a full 10 seconds, following which an elderly man abruptly sprang to his feet before yelling in a voice that was on the verge of tears, \"Get me the best wine in the house!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, the elderly man habitually dabbed at his own eyes. Even though Yin spirits had no tears, he was feeling extremely emotional, far more than he had ever felt during his time in the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He picked up his cup in a shaky manner, then held it up with both hands as he extended a bow toward the west. \"Grandpa, Grandma... You can both rest easy now...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The populations of all underworlds primarily consisted of elderly people who had died from old age, while young people who had died from natural causes only constituted a minority. In this restaurant, 90% of the patrons were elderly individuals, and for people of their age, even if they hadn't participated in the war against Nippon, they would've definitely been born not far away from the founding of the new Cathay, which meant that many of their older relatives would've been part of the war.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, memories of those times would've still been fresh in their mind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice seemed to have snapped everyone out of their reverie, and all of the Yin spirits in the restaurant immediately returned to life. Another elderly man slammed a hand down onto his table as he yelled, \"Get me the best wine you have as well! Hurry! And give me an order of all your restaurant's signature dishes! Drink up, everyone!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I never thought I would ever see this day... Manager! Where are you? This calls for celebration!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, the entire restaurant had erupted into a frenzy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Cathayans, everyone couldn't help but be excited to hear this news.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the restaurant patrons who were completely unfamiliar with one another were gathering like old friends, joining their table together and drinking to their heart's content. All of a sudden, the entire restaurant was filled with exuberance and vitality.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was joy and excitement that came from the bottom of everyone's hearts!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Many years ago, my father said he was going to fight in the war, and he never came back...\" An elderly man downed the contents of his cup in one go, and his face immediately became slightly flushed. It was clear that he was not a regular drinker, but at this moment, he was drinking like there was no tomorrow.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's a similar story in my family. A few of my uncles and aunts were said to have traveled across half the nation with the Red Army, but we never heard from them again.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The young people nowadays don't like to hear these stories anymore. They don't know what we've seen on the battlefields and in the trenches!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Let's drink to all our lost loved ones!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Cheers!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the patrons of the restaurant, regardless of whether they knew each other or not, brought their cups together before throwing their heads back and downing their wine.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Similar scenes were unfolding across the entire nation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entirety of the Cathayan Underworld had erupted into a frenzy, but the city of Jinling was the most boisterous of them all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The governor, administrative commissioner, and all of the officials of Jinling rose to their feet in silence, unable to believe what they were seeing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the streets, countless passersby were staring up at the live broadcast playing out on the large screens with dumbfounded expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Inside a university, a professor's mouth was gaped wide open as he adjusted his own glasses in disbelief, while all of the students in the hall had risen to their feet with their eyes wide open.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire city was silent for a moment, but that silence soon gave way to thunderous cheers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless elderly Yin spirits rushed home before pulling out the memorial tablets of their passed relatives, clutching the tablets in their arms as they bawled their eyes out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hell had been defunct for a century, so their parents and relatives were unable to enter the underworld, thereby making it common for memorial tablets to be kept to commemorate those relatives.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Can you see this?\" An elderly man was sobbing so vigorously that his voice had turned hoarse. Yin spirits had no tears, but anyone could sense the power of the emotions in his heart. \"The heavens have finally answered our prayers!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After weeping for over 10 minutes, he suddenly clambered to his feet before pulling a candle out of a cupboard, then rushed toward the city center like a madman.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, there were no longer any beast-drawn carriages available to be hailed at this point.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, he rushed toward the city center on foot, but he quickly discovered that all of the streets leading to the central plaza of the city were already packed to the rafters.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Almost all of the Yin spirits were holding a candle, just like he was, and even though the streets were extremely packed, there was no shoving, and no one voiced any discontent. All of the Yin spirits were silently gathering toward the same place.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a full half-hour did the elderly man finally arrive on the plaza, and at this point, the plaza was already filled with kneeling Yin spirits who had their palms joined together in prayer.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one was saying anything, but gentle sobs could be heard. It seemed that everyone was reminiscing about that horrific era they had lived through, while also praying to their lost relatives.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the center of the plaza was a stone plaque, upon which was written a line of bright red text in six different languages, namely Cathayan, Nipponese, Brittannian, Hindustani, Argosian, and Aegyptian.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The resting place of over 300,000 Cathayan citizens from the Nanjing Massacre.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Below that was another short message: \"Lest we forget.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The plaza was surrounded by antiquated tall buildings and shopping malls, but not a single one of the surrounding buildings dared to play any music in this moment. It was as if the entire city were observing a moment of silence in the wake of this historic event.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In reality, the Yin spirits on the plaza weren't in mourning or holding a memorial service. Instead, they were bidding farewell to those unforgettable memories and all of those names that were constantly on their mind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the day on which all of those lost souls could rest easy in the knowledge that they had been avenged.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Most of the Yin spirits on the plaza were at quite an advanced age, and they were gathered before the stone plaque under a somber atmosphere. Each one was holding a lit candle, and looking down from above, it was as if the entire center of Jinling were a sea of candle flames, illuminating the black plaque at the center.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, the surrounding screens flickered slightly, and the broadcast of the Nipponese Underworld's unconditional surrender announcement that was playing on repeat finally faded. What had replaced it was an image of Qin Changxin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Good afternoon, everyone.\" Qin Changxin extended a bow toward the camera with a smile on his face. \"I will now be announcing our Cathayan Underworld's intended arrangements after the unconditional surrender of the Nipponese Underworld. Firstly, the former ruler of the Nipponese Underworld, Izanami, and Susanoo-no-Mikoto, will immigrate to Everburn to live out the rest of their days.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This announcement didn't trigger any discussion. The general public didn't care what became of the former leaders of the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin seemed to be aware of this as well, and he immediately continued, \"Secondly, the Nipponese Underworld will now become a province of the Cathayan Underworld. All of the officials that will be instated to oversee the new province of Nippon will be drawn from the Cathayan Underworld within the next month. In addition to that, I have been assigned with the role of the governor of Nippon province.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This announcement created a massive stir across the entire Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Nipponese Underworld had stood for thousands of years, yet it had ceased to exist! It had become Nippon province, a natural barrier to the east of the Cathayan Underworld, and from this point onward, the entirety of Eastern Asia had been unified!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thank the heavens!\" In a small county to the west, an elderly man who appeared to be in his nineties was yelling with all his might, and his cheeks were flushed bright red from excitement. \"I am so blessed to have been able to witness this!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin's voice continued to echo throughout the entire Cathayan Underworld. \"Through our investigation, we have deemed that the seven A-grade war criminals, Tōjō Hideki, Iwane Matsui, Akira Mutō, Seishirō Itagaki, Kōki Hirota, Heitarō Kimura, and Kenji Doihara will be relegated to the Path of the Beast of our Cathayan Underworld's six paths of reincarnation, where they will be confined for 200 years. At the same time, the main perpetrators of the Nanjing Massacre, Iwane Matsui and Hisao Tani, will be apprehended and taken to the city of Jinling, where their souls will be crushed beneath the commemorative plaque of the Nanjing Massacre for 300 years.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the netherworldly citizens were celebrating to their hearts' content, while the officials of the Cathayan Underworld were already looking ahead to the new opportunities that could be presented to them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From village heads to provincial governors, there were countless vacant roles in the new province of Nippon!

It was like the center between two forbidden arts, and ferocious shockwaves were released one after another. In particular, the Yin energy from both sides were crashing violently against one another between Formosa and the Nippon Sea, as if they were fighting for supremacy.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"My god...\" On all of the ships that were still yet to have reached the shore, the crew members were all kneeling in their cabins with their palms joined together, praying with all their might.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the signal for the Cathayan Underworld's resurgence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld was telling everyone that even after 100 years of isolation, it was still a world-leading superpower.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was able to see all of this as he released his consciousness from the top of the tenshu pavilion, and a pleased smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several decades ago, he had created the new Hell on his own, and his only ally was Arthis, who bullied him for fun.

However, the third King Yanluo was able to complete this ambitious feat after several thousand years. In doing so, he has unified eastern Asia, as well as granting the Cathayan Underworld a natural barrier against the west. From now on, the provinces of Nippon and Formosa will act as an effective barrier for the Cathayan Underworld against potential invaders. Conquering the Nipponese Underworld allows the Cathayan Underworld to expand its territorial sea eastward to the center of the Atlantic Ocean and perhaps even beyond that. Regardless of whether it's in terms of strategic value or for the procurement of resources, this achievement is invaluable. In the history of the underworld, this is a feat second only to the unification of the Cathayan Underworld by the first King Yanluo.

In the next instant, everything before his eyes exploded, and it was as if the entire world had been shattered. A vast expanse of pure golden light completely enveloped his entire body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, he was struck by a sense of drowsiness that made him involuntarily want to close his eyes. It was as if he had returned to his mother's womb, and he felt extremely warm and content. His skin and body also seemed to have returned to their most sensitive state, and a gentle hand was carefully arranging all of his meridians.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He slowly closed his eyes, so unbeknownst to him, his bones were slowly transitioning toward a pure golden color, while his blood and flesh was also beginning to turn white.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It wasn't a deathly white color.

He slowly opened his eyes, and he could still see that he was basked in a vast expanse of golden radiance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He gently exhaled as he attempted to stretch his limbs. He didn't know how long he had been sleeping for, but as he stretched his own body, all of his joints cracked and popped in quick succession.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first feeling that had occurred to him was that he had grown more powerful.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If his body had been forged from iron back when he was an advanced Yama-King, then he would be a man of steel right now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had a feeling that even if he had to take a forbidden art head-on, he definitely wouldn't have to fall into a slumber.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Despite the significant improvements in his power, he could sense that he still hadn't reached Zhao Yun's level yet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was a little disappointed by this observation. At the time, Zhao Yun had devoured the soul of Genghis Khan by chance. Genghis Khan and Izanami were both rulers of underworlds, but they were completely different in status.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami was merely the ruler of a third-rate underworld for 2,000 years, while Genghis Khan was the almighty ruler who had led the Mongol Empire to sweep across the entirety of Asia and Europe! There was no comparison between the two regardless of whether it came to territory or achievements. Ultimately, Izanami hadn't even created the Nipponese Underworld, so she was nothing more than an imposter death god.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Qin Ye wasn't feeling despondent, either.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After all, as the third King Yanluo, the Harken and Zhao Yun would always be present to protect him from danger. If worse came to worst, he could always rely on the cheat code that was the second King Yanluo, so it wasn't actually all that important whether he transcended beyond the Yama-King level at all. The only thing that the breakthrough would do for him was afford him an extra degree of safety.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Space exploration was the final step of his plan, and once he opened the planar walls, he would have to face extraterrestrial civilizations, which would also have beings above the Yama-King level.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, he continued to assess his own newfound power.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't beyond the Yama-King level, but at the same time, he no longer seemed to be a Yama-King, either. Instead, it felt like he was somewhere in between the two.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could sense some clear differences compared with back when he was a Yama-King, and the most prominent change was that his Yin energy had disappeared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An indescribable aura had taken its place. It was darker than true energy, but brighter than Yin energy, and more profound than immortal energy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What cultivation rank is this?\" He tried to stretch out his own body, and right at this moment, a string of loud cracks suddenly rang out around him. Countless fractures appeared on the surface of the surrounding golden cocoon, following which it abruptly exploded and disintegrated into dust.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A familiar scene appeared before his eyes, and he adjusted his own robes. Right as he was about to take a step forward in a triumphant fashion, an excited voice suddenly rang out from behind him. \"Three to King straight!

It's quite remarkable that you've managed to reach this point. Go just a step further from here and you'll truly become a formidable force in the universe.\"</span></p>"

Countless inky-black lotus flowers had bloomed all around him on the nearby mountains, the moat in front of his tenshu pavilions, and all of the surrounding rock faces!

In the next instant, all of the black lotus flowers trembled in unison before flying up into the sky as fast as lightning. An impenetrable screen of Yin energy quickly appeared in the sky, then surged in its entirety toward Tokyo.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What on earth is that?!\" Tokugawa Ieyasu was looking up at the sky with an astonished expression. In the span of no more than a few minutes, the boundless screen of Yin energy had transformed day into night. It was as if the sun had been devoured, and immediately thereafter, the vast expanse of darkness above the tenshu pavilion beganto revolve and warp before finally forming a massive vortex!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What's happening?

We issued sufficient fees, so why are we not entitled to receive...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Ambassador Abdullah had a chance to finish, several spears were aimed directly at his throat, and his voice instantly trailed off into silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Outside the Hindustani Underworld's energy resource outlet, around a dozen Yin soldiers were assembled in a row. They were led by a commander who wasn't particularly tall or physically imposing, but there was no concealing the killing intent radiating from his body, and it was clear that he was a Yin soldier who had been in actual battles in the past.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after Abdullah and his peers fell silent did he make a hand gesture, instructing his soldiers to lower their spears. \"The province of Formosa will be going into lockdown for a week. During this time, no Yin spirits are permitted to leave the island. The Cathayan Underworld will satisfy all of your needs, and all those who attempt to leave the island without permission will be detained as spies.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's not fair!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're telling me we have to stay in this building for a week?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What's the reason for this? You have to give us a proper explanation!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I apologize for the inconvenience caused to everyone,\" the commander said with a steely expression. \"You will be compensated by the Cathayan Underworld after the event, but for now, you must do as you're told. During the lockdown period, you're only restricted in your movement, but there are no restrictions on anything else. As for everyday necessities, those will be delivered to you in half an hour.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, the row of Yin soldiers stationed themselves in front of the entrance, and Abdullah could only return to the building with tightly furrowed brows.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After returning to his office, Abdullah glanced out his window to find that all of the shops and other national energy resource outposts had also been placed under lockdown.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Hindustani Underworld's energy resource outpost wasn't just responsible for arranging imports and exports of energy resources. At the same time, it was also collaborating with the Cathayan Underworld in new energy resource research. Thus, due to the large number of Yin spirits employed there, the building was very tall. Just like the other buildings belonging to the three pillars, this building towered over all of the other buildings on the island of Formosa, and from this vantage point, Abdullah was able to clearly see every single corner of the island.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What is going on?\" Abdullah returned to his seat and poured himself a cup of coffee as his gaze roamed over the island with tightly furrowed brows. There was no way that the Cathayan Underworld would decide to place the entire island under lockdown for no reason, so there had to be an explanation for this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The jobs of all diplomats had certain areas of overlap with the duties of spies.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were responsible for reporting what they learned back to their nation as quickly as possible, so essentially, they were official spies who worked out in the open.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Abdullah had already been working at Formosa for 10 years, and with the experience that he had accumulated during this time, he had a strong feeling that something big was about to happen on the island.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to think about anything else, the entire world suddenly trembled slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a very strange feeling.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if the sky had suddenly turned dark before clearing up again in the brief span of a millisecond.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Abdullah faltered slightly upon seeing this, then immediately sprang to his feet, knocking over his teacup in the process, but he paid no heed to that as he stared intently at the tall mountain range on the horizon. As a Soul Hunter, he could clearly sense a burst of incredibly powerful Yin energy fluctuations surging toward the island.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, the fluctuations were only growing more and more powerful. It was like the butterfly effect, triggering only a slight breeze in the beginning, only for the breeze to build up into a ferocious storm!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He looked on with an alarmed expression as the clouds near the Alishan Mountains rapidly receded, and the horizon began to blur, much like the visual effect of heat rising up from hot tarmac to warp the air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A terrifying thought sprang into his mind, and his throat immediately ran dry as he suddenly stumbled back a few steps. His body was trembling uncontrollably, and he was only snapped out of his stunned stupor as he bumped into his own desk.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, an all-encompassing wave of darkness erupted from the Alishan Mountains.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It swept over the entire world so quickly that it was as if it had never appeared in the first place. Perhaps the split-second of darkness was too brief to even be detected by the retinas of normal Yin spirits.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The darkness disintegrated as soon as it appeared, but it didn't drift down from the heavens. Instead, it transformed into countless black butterflies that surged toward Formosa like a river of darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were flying extremely quickly, and in the blink of an eye, they had already formed a vast sea of clouds above the island. The clouds were constantly surging and revolving, devouring the sun and concealing all light. Within the span of less than an hour, the entire sky had been concealed behind a wave of darkness.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the center of the darkness was a massive vortex, around which lightning was flashing incessantly. All of a sudden, a pillar of black light came crashing down from the vortex, directly striking the Alishan Mountains.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, Abdullah had already seen enough to understand what was happening, and he instantly lost all sense of composure as he yelled, \"There's a new Yama-King arising in the Cathayan Underworld! My god!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, he rushed over to his phone like a madman before frantically picking up the receiver. \"Connect me to the embassy! Hurry!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, he wasn't the only one witnessing this spectacular scene.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was so grand and vast that countless underworld emissaries across the world were able to see the phenomenon that had encompassed Foromsa. At the same time, the phones on the desks of all of the death gods began to ring in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the Hindustani Underworld, Yamaraja heaved a faint sigh before setting down the receiver of his phone. \"Two Yama-Kings, eh?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The benefits of war were on full display here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld is making preparations for the opening of the Array of the Nine Gods...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With two new Yama-Kings soon to join its ranks, the Cathayan Underworld's power already far exceeded that of the Russian Underworld. In addition to that, there was the combination of super high altitude flying shuttles and Death God, and taking that into account, the Cathayan Underworld was already infinitely approaching the other three pillars in power.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only thing they were lacking in comparison was their foundation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He heaved a long sigh before standing up and making his way to the window, where he looked out at the Hindustani Underworld. \"It'll take the Cathayan Underworld many more centuries to accumulate the same foundation it had during its heyday, but so long as Death God continues to exist, no one will be able to make a move against it. It has truly risen up again from the ashes.\"</span></p>"

All of the torii gates and shimenawas had been destroyed in an instant, and the earth had shattered violently, allowing a sea of lethal radiance to erupt up from down below.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She saw countless screaming Yin spirits around her being inundated by the sea of light before they were erased out of existence, following which their souls drifted up into the heavens.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How is this possible? What have we been attacked by? Even a forbidden art isn't this powerful! At the very most, a forbidden art would only be on par in power with Minakanushi!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Never in the past several thousand years of her existence had she been at such a complete loss for what to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several seconds later, she lowered her head in a dazed manner before picking up a handful of sand, then watched as it was swept away in the wind. Only after a long while did her voice return to her. \"Itoku?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one answered her.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only sound was the fierce wind howling through the vast desert.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Hirose?

They would always appear when she needed them, and they never referred to themselves by their names in her presence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was still no response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami's expression remained unchanged. In the instant that she opened her eyes and saw everything around her, her heart had become as barren as this desert.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Deep down inside, she had already died, and it was as if she were no longer capable of feeling any emotions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She wasn't an idiot. The scene around her was enough to tell her that the Nipponese Underworld had been attacked by a type of new weapon, one that was even more fearsome than forbidden arts. Kyoto had been completely destroyed, and she didn't know how many other cities had also suffered the same fate. However, she was still holding onto one final shred of hope that this was just an illusion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The desert stretched on in all directions as far as her eyes could see, and it was as if Amano-Iwato had never existed at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The streets and buildings that had existed not long ago seemed like memories of the distant past now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami's chest was heaving slightly as she took a moment to arrange her hair, then asked, \"Is there anyone here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was still no answer.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami remained seated in silence with her legs tucked beneath her on the desert, as if she were reminiscing about her past. Only after a full half-hour had passed did she stand up as she closed her eyes with a forlorn sigh.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why did I have to devote myself so completely to the three pillars? Why did I insist on going against the Cathayan Underworld?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two nations were situated so close to one another. If she had chosen the Cathayan Underworld, then both nations would've benefitted, but she had chosen the wrong side.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The fate of the Nipponese Underworld had been sealed from the very beginning. Ever since she took that firm stance during the conference in Nara, the demise of the Nipponese Underworld had already been decided.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She had tried to mend the fractured relationship between the two nations, but the Cathayan Underworld had never reciprocated her efforts. She had thought that the Cathayan Underworld's moves to encourage interaction between civilian-run enterprises would be a catalyst for the two nations to come together again, but it turned out that those measures were just the beginning to a sinister plan.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no use in lingering on regrets.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami picked up the hem of her kimono before slowly strolling along the desert. She was the Nipponese Underworld's first and final death god, and she had to face the remaining netherworldly citizens of her nation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, a patch of sand in the desert shifted slightly, and a humanoid figure struggled to their feet. As soon as they caught sight of Izanami, they immediately came stumbling toward her.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Izanami's expression finally changed slightly upon seeing this, and she reflexively extended a hand toward them. Even though she didn't recognize the figure stumbling toward her, it was still some solace for her to see another living Yin spirit.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that the Yin spirit grabbed onto her hand, he immediately urged in a trembling voice, \"Your Excellency... It's time to surrender... We can't resist any longer...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What little color that was left in Izanami's cheeks quickly faded, but a smile appeared on her face as she nodded in response. \"Indeed, it's time...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">…………………………</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Cathayan Underworld, Ashmound.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The city was brightly lit regardless of whether it was day or night. As one of the two major cities of the Cathayan Underworld, Ashmound was the equivalent of Shanghai of the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The city was also home to the Cathayan Underworld's naval headquarters. During the past few years, all of the troops that had been sent to the Hanyang Underworld had set off from here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Cheers.\" Inside the most luxurious booth of one of the most high-end restaurants in Ashmound, a man raised his cup in a graceful manner before extending a slight bow toward the others at the table.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was wearing a black robe with golden chrysanthemum flowers embroidered upon it, and there was a white jade hairpin in his hair. He was quite thin and didn't appear to be remarkable in any way, but the servers of the restaurant that were bringing dishes into the booth were taking extra care not to make any sound, and the manager and vice-manager of the restaurant were both standing outside the booth with anxious expressions, overseeing every little detail to ensure that there were no faults with their service.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Three underworld emissaries were seated around the eight-immortal table, and at the head of the table was a slightly rotund elderly man who had a very benevolent appearance. Two middle-aged underworld emissaries, one male and one female, were seated at the table with him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three of them downed the contents of their cups in one go, following which the elderly man stroked his white beard as he chuckled, \"This meal isn't being paid for with public funds, is it, Governor Zhang?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course not,\" the thin man replied with a smile. \"Among the new generation of Yin spirits, I'm the only one to have reached this status. There are countless underworld emissaries from the older generation watching my every move, hoping that I slip up, so I certainly wouldn't dare to do something as foolish as use public funds for my meals. Rest assured, this is all coming out of my own pocket, so please go easy on the orders.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Haha, of course.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shortly into the meal, Governor Zhang filled the elderly man's cup once again, then finally asked, \"Do you know what's going on here, Director Fang? Why are all provincial-level officials suddenly being examined?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Director Fang shook his head in response. \"I'm afraid I don't.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Governor Zhang had a chance to ask any more questions, he continued with furrowed brows, \"All of the new generation of underworld emissaries want to see you promoted into the central government, but they're encountering quite a bit of resistance. After all, the old guard has been with Yanluo Qin from the very beginning, and we don't have the power to contend with them yet. Among the 50 members of the standing committee, we only have seven or eight, so we're not privy to a lot of information. Going by past convention, examinations like this are only conducted once every 10 years, but it's only been five years since the last examination, and personnel from our organization department were sent to each province to conduct the examinations in person. If you ask me...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He took a glance out of the booth, then lowered his voice as he concluded, \"I think there's going to be a very important position vacated soon.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What makes you say that?\" Governor Zhang asked with a serious expression. \"All of the high-ranking provincial officials have undergone countless trials to reach their current positions, and nationwide examinations are only conducted in major cases where all of the officials of a province are involved, but I haven't heard of any cases of that magnitude recently.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's what's strange about this situation,\" Director Fang sighed. \"Unfortunately for us, we don't have the connections that'll grant us access to this information, so we'll just have to wait and see...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as his voice trailed off, the doors of the booth were suddenly opened, and the restaurant's manager carefully made his way into the room. As soon as he arrived at the table, he immediately bowed as he said, \"Esteemed guests, I carry some instructions for you...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Director Fang and Governor Zhang were astonished to hear this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instructions had been sent to this restaurant? And they were being delivered by the restaurant manager? Was this supposed to be a prank?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An awkward look appeared on the manager's face as he explained, \"Just now, Department Six informed the entire city that all television stations and screens in shopping malls will be switched to Cathay Underworld Central Television Channel One in 10 minutes. This instruction came from the central government, so I had no choice but to come in and inform you. Please pardon my intrusion.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Director Fang nodded in response, and the manager pressed a button, upon which a screen was lowered down from one of the walls of the booth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What's the meaning of this?\" Director Zhang's brows furrowed even tighter upon hearing this. \"A special broadcast? Even I haven't heard anything about this!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That can only mean that the instruction came straight from the central government without passing through any other avenues,\" Director Fang replied. \"There must be an extremely important announcement that's about to be made. Let's wait and see.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Not 10 minutes later, the screen flickered slightly, and&nbsp;a woman with a head of white hair wearing a Nipponese kimono appeared on the screen.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I am the ruler death god of what was once the Nipponese Underworld, Izanami,\" the woman said as she extended a slight bow. \"I will now be reading out the terms of the Nipponese Underworld's unconditional surrender.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both Director Fang and Governor Zhang immediately sprang to their feet upon hearing this, and the netherfire in their eyes sprang up like flaming pillars in disbelief.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They weren't the only ones shocked to hear this. At this moment, all of the Yin spirits throughout the Cathayan Underworld were staring at their television screens with their jaws on the ground.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a live broadcast of the Nipponese Underworld's unconditional surrender declaration!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Director Fang and Governor Zhang were both enlightened upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No wonder a nationwide examination was taking place! There weren't just vacancies in a province, there were vacancies throughout the newly conquered Nipponese Underworld that had to be filled!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The two of them were barely able to repress their excitement as they continued to watch the broadcast.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"...

I hereby declare that all armored forces and netherworldly citizens in the Nipponese Underworld are to cease all resistance.

In the end, she closed the imperial edict before lowering her head. \"The Nipponese Underworld and its government will follow all arrangements set out by the ruler of the Cathayan Underworld. The ruler of the Cathayan Underworld will be free to take all measures that they deem to be necessary to complete the proceedings of the unconditional surrender.\"</span></p>"

He had a feeling that he would be asking for a beating if he said that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Earth was such a good place! He was already at the very top of the food chain, and all he wanted was to stay in this safe haven and go into an easy early retirement.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, he quickly changed the subject, turning his attention to Qin Changxin. \"Congratulations!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin was giving off Yama-King level Yin energy fluctuations, and in contrast with other Cathayan Yama-Kings, his eyeballs had completely vanished from their sockets, replaced by two specks of bright crimson netherfire, and there were faint flashes of electricity occasionally arcing over his entire body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's all thanks to you, Your Excellency!\" Qin Changxin was extremely excited. Never did he think that he would be able to reach such dizzying heights. Just this breakthrough alone made his decision to defect to the Cathayan Underworld completely worth it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After all, even though he held the title of the governor of Nippon, the Cathayan Underworld was still above him, so it hardly mattered.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He was the one who had truly unified the Nipponese Underworld! Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the others could only wait in the tenshu pavilion down below for their fiefdoms to be assigned, unable to even come to this level!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's a good thing that Yama-King Qin was in the Cathayan Underworld.\" The Harken leaped onto Qin Ye's shoulder in a well-rehearsed motion, then reflexively moved slightly before catching itself. It seemed that its muscle memory involved jumping up a step further onto Qin Ye's head, but it refrained from doing so considering they were still in Qin Changxin's presence. \"Due to the limitations of the Nipponese Underworld, Yama-King Qin wouldn't have been able to make his breakthrough there. However, after returning to the Cathayan Underworld, he was able to benefit from the vast Yin energy in the nation, thereby allowing him to make a smooth breakthrough.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's right.\" Qin Changxin took a deep breath to repress his own excitement, then cupped his fist in a salute. \"I will never forget what the Cathayan Underworld has done for me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Harken didn't seem to have heard him at all as it continued, \"However, even the Cathayan Underworld wouldn't have been able to support two Yama-King level breakthroughs at once prior to conquering the Nipponese Underworld. Thankfully, after the fall of the Nipponese Underworld, there arose a slight chance for such a feat to be accomplished. Thus, at the time, I took Yama-King Qin to the nearest island of Formosa for him to make his breakthrough.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye raised an eyebrow upon hearing this. \"Does he not need to make his breakthrough in the Nipponese Underworld?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Harken replied, \"The Nipponese Underworld already belongs to the Cathayan Underworld. Seeing as it's all part of the same nation, it doesn't matter where he completes his breakthrough. However.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It turned to Qin Changxin with a meaningful expression as it continued, \"If the Nipponese Underworld ever becomes independent again, it'll no longer belong to the Cathayan Underworld, and the Yin energy and power of worship there will plummet. If that happens, Yama-King Qin most likely won't be able to retain his current cultivation rank.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were clearly some implications behind its words.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In saying this, it was telling Qin Ye that it was safe to hand over the reins of the Nipponese Underworld to Qin Changxin. As long as he didn't want to part with his current cultivation rank, he was never going to betray the Cathayan Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, this was also a subtle warning to Qin Changxin, telling him that any attempt to liberate the Nipponese Underworld in the future would be directly to his detriment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin nodded with a smile while heaving a long internal sigh. Ultimately, he still wasn't a Yin spirit of the Cathayan Underworld. Even though he had been granted the Qin surname, there was no changing the fact that his true name was still Oda Nobunaga.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Yue Fei or Zhao Yun had taken on the role of governor of Nippon, the Harken wouldn't have felt the need to issue that veiled warning. If he wanted to completely integrate himself into the Cathayan Underworld, there would still be several generations of work that had to be done, and during this time, Hell would undoubtedly always remain a little wary of his Oda Clan.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Some things were too hurtful to be directly articulated, so they were better left implied and unsaid. Thus, the Harken didn't speak any further on this matter. Instead, it whipped its tail at Qin Ye's cheek before changing the subject.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"All new Yama-Kings must be presented to the entire nation for a celebration. Now that we have universities, they will also need to tour the universities and give speeches there. Most importantly, all new Yama-Kings need to have a title assigned to them by King Yanluo in person.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye thought about this for a moment, then said, \"Among the Yama-Kings of the 10 Palaces of the old Hell, all of them were given titles based on their fiefdoms with a few special exceptions. For example, there was the Chu River King of the second palace, the Biancheng King of the six palace, and the Mount Tai King of the seventh palace. In this case, Yama-King Qin is the governor of the Nipponese Underworld, and the capital city of the Nipponese Underworld, Kyoto, was known in ancient times as Heian-kyō. Thus, I give you the title of the Heian King, and it also has a double meaning of peace, so it symbolizes a desire for peace and prosperity. What do you all think?\" [In Japanese, heian (平安) translates to \"peace\".]</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone turned to Qin Changxin for his opinion, and he immediately cupped his fist in a salute while extending a respectful bow. \"I couldn't think of a more perfect title!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, Hell had reinstated two of its Yama-Kings of the 10 Palaces in the form of Reincarnation King Arakshasa and Heian King Qin Changxin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In fact, there was a third one!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a deep breath, then asked, \"How long have I been in seclusion for? Where is General Yue?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You've been gone for a month,\" the Harken replied. \"General Yue is also in the tenshu pavilion, and he was planning to meet you as soon as you emerged from seclusion, but he's been delayed by some minor inconveniences.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Ye had a chance to reply, it said, \"This is something that you have to take care of in person. No one else can help you here.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, it casually swatted its tail against the back of Qin Ye's head, earning itself an indignant glare.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"General Yue, I'm not to blame for what happened back then!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Ye had even fully made his way down the staircase, he was greeted by the sound of a sobbing voice on the first floor.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Think about it, General Yue! During our dynasty, generals weren't granted any military power! In the early stages after the establishment of the Southern Song Dynasty, large numbers of soldiers were deployed to ensure stability. Once the nation was stabilized, the emperor naturally wanted to kill off some of these armed forces. Generals at the time had an abundance of both wealth and soldiers at the time, so they posed a threat to the emperor himself, and you were one of the leading figures among the generals!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye had already made his way to the bottom of the staircase, but he stopped there and continued to listen with an intrigued expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were countless depictions of Yue Fei's death in different history books, and he wanted to hear the truth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The hall fell silent, and only after a long while did Yue Fei's calm voice ring out in response. \"Is that all you have to say?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No, that's not all!\" The sobbing voice rang out again. \"After you quelled the rebellions, you accepted donations to fund your army. Of course, a large proportion of those funds were provided by the local officials and the general public in the hope that you'll continue to advance your army northward, but the emperor wasn't willing to accept that! Also, there was an instance where you spoke directly to the emperor regarding the issue of an heir. His Majesty had no sons, and no one in the imperial court dared to bring up this subject! Please pardon me for being blunt, but you were digging your own grave! \"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was silence once again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face as he turned to the Harken on his shoulder, then asked, \"When did Qin Hui come here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before the Harken had a chance to reply, the second King Yanluo's voice rang out from behind him. \"He first came about a month ago, and ever since then, he's been coming every day to cry and repent.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye turned around to find the second King Yanluo eavesdropping with glee in the corner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Do you have to eavesdrop so blatantly?\" Qin Ye scoffed with a disdainful expression.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, the second King Yanluo gently cleared his throat, and a table in the corner was instantly reduced to dust. He didn't appear to have done anything, and there were no signs indicating that any power had been released from his body.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyelids twitched violently upon hearing this, and he immediately put on a fawning smile as he said, \"What I meant to say that you shouldn't be so dashing and handsome even when eavesdropping as that places undue pressure on your fellow eavesdroppers. You should learn to blend in with the masses and not be so outrageously perfect all the time.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo smiled as he patted Qin Ye on the head. \"I know none of that was true, but I'll let you off the hook for now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Ye had a chance to say anything else, the second King Yanluo withdrew his hand, then gestured toward the room as he asked, \"What are you going to do?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Hui was renowned as a slimy character in history, but he was also very capable of contributing greatly to the construction of the new Hell. Furthermore, he had surrendered himself to the Cathayan Underworld, so killing him would make Qin Ye seem like an ungracious and unforgiving ruler, but leaving him alive could lead to discontent from Yue Fei.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's not my decision, it's about what General Yue wants to do,\" Qin Ye replied.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo raised an eyebrow with a surprised expression, then nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's intentions here were very clear. They were in a tenshu pavilion in the province of Nippon, so if Yue Fei really wanted to kill Qin Hui here, then no one from the Cathayan Underworld would find out. The only witnesses nearby were the daimyos, and they were only interested in securing their fiefdoms, so Qin Changxin would only have to issue a non-disclosure order to silence them in order to prevent them from spreading the news. After that, they could simply proclaim that Qin Hui had been killed by the residual resistant forces in the Nipponese Underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, the Nipponese Underworld had already been conquered, but there were still armed rebellions taking place in many of the cities, and the Cathayan Underworld's forces were all waiting for Qin Ye to come out of seclusion to issue them with instructions in how to deal with the rebellions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The room was silent for a full 10 minutes before Yue Fei finally said, \"I actually already knew all of that.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The sound of chair legs scraping across the floor rang out, and Yue Fei seemed to have stood up as he said, \"During the past few centuries, I've been confined to this room, and during that time, I've thought about many things.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Hui offered no reply aside from his incessant weeping.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're not to blame,\" Yue Fei said, and a faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Yue Fei really had killed Qin Hui, Qin Ye wouldn't have punished him, but his image of Yue Fei would be negatively affected as a result.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Yue Fei had killed Qin Hui for the sole purpose of exacting vengeance and venting his fury, then Qin Ye would be quite concerned about such a petty and potentially volatile figure serving as one of the Cathayan Underworld's Yama-Kings.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thankfully, Yue Fei hadn't disappointed him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You were only being used by the emperor at the time. Given my status, there was no way you could've killed me without the emperor's approval, so you were never the true perpetrator.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, Qin Ye burst into applause and made his way into the room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yanluo Qin!\" In the instant that Qin Ye appeared in the room, Qin Hui rapidly scurried over to him on his knees, then kowtowed onto the floor so heavily that the entire room trembled slightly as he said in a sobbing voice, \"I swear that I never resented General Yue! I would've never plotted against him had the emperor not exerted so much pressure on me! You have to believe me!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You can get up,\" Qin Ye said. \"Seeing as General Yue has already forgiven you, I'm certainly willing to let things slide. From now on, both of you will be serving Hell, so you have to work together and help one another. Also, who's overseeing proceedings in the three eastern provinces in your absence? You should go back as soon as possible to resume your official duties.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before Qin Hui had a chance to express his gratitude, Qin Ye's smile faded as he declared, \"Get ready. In 10 minutes, we'll be holding our first meeting between Yama-Kings.\"</span></p>"

Qin Ye, Arakshasa, Qin Changxin, the Harken, Yue Fei, and Zhao Yun had all taken a seat.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a very spacious hall with a very pronounced Nipponese-style design, and Qin Ye turned to Qin Changxin with a smile as he said, \"Heian King, the Nipponese Underworld may have been conquered, but there's still a lot of work left to be done, wouldn't you agree?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first thing to do was to quell all of the rebellions still taking place in the nation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course,\" Qin Changxin replied in a confident voice. \"I've decided that as soon as the situation is stabilized, I'll send out all of the daimyos to quell the rebellions and unrest in the nation. Also, I have a few suggestions to make, and I'd like to humbly present them to you now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin had been thinking for several decades about how to rule over the Nipponese Underworld, so he was extremely well prepared to discuss this topic. \"The first suggestion relates to the topic of netherworldly citizens. In order to instill a sense of belonging into the netherworldly citizens as soon as possible, I've decided to scatter the distribution of netherworldly citizens.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin wasn't expecting Qin Changxin to be so advanced in his thinking, and he raised an eyebrow as he gestured for Qin Changxin to continue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Changxin explained, \"From this day forth, the daimyos will be responsible for quelling the nation's rebellions, while I'll be overseeing the construction of super-long-distance teleportation arrays in the eight regions of the Nipponese Underworld. Those teleportation arrays will be connected to eight major metropolitan areas in the Cathayan Underworld. There will be underworld emissaries overseeing seamless soul capturing connections, and all captured souls will immediately be taken to the Cathayan Underworld, while the Nipponese Underworld will temporarily retain only 50 million netherworldly citizens.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He made a grabbing motion, and a document appeared out of thin air before falling in front of all of the Yama-Kings. \"At the moment, there are 350 million netherworldly citizens in the Nipponese Underworld. Aside from the 50 million netherworldly citizens to remain in the Nipponese Underworld, the other 300 million will all be transferred to the major cities across the Cathayan Underworld. From then onward, the Nipponese Underworld will only retain 20% of the new netherworldly citizens that enter the underworld every year, and the rest will continue to be moved to the Cathayan Underworld. This arrangement will go on for 200 years.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was quite a vicious decision to make, and all of the Yama-Kings silently exchanged a glance upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Essentially, he was undermining the nation and severing the heritage of the Shinto religion!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If this were in Usonia, there was no way that this proposal would be approved. Usonia was an immigration nation, so it didn't have the solidarity built up over the course of thousands of years. However, this was possible in the Cathayan Underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If there were any nation in the world that would definitely be unified again after being completely fractured, then it could only be Cathay!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The concept of grand unification was one that was deeply ingrained in the hearts of all Cathayans. At the same time, the Cathayan Underworld was also the nation most adept at assimilating other cultures. Once the Nipponese Underworld's netherworldly citizens were sent to the Cathayan Underworld, it would only take three generations before the vast majority of them stopped abiding by Nipponese habits and traditions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's a good idea,\" Zhao Yun replied with a nod. \"Is there anything else?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course,\" Qin Changxin said. \"In order to make them completely accept their identity as netherworldly citizens of the Cathayan Underworld, our Cathayan Underworld needs to be sufficiently powerful. At the moment, we just barely satisfy that prerequisite, but even more importantly, we have to focus on the education sector. I'll make sure all teaching materials are rewritten, and all laws, currency, clothing, and every other integral part of society is changed to match those of the Cathayan Underworld. There will be some resistance to these changes at first, but I'm determined to see them through.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the Yama-Kings nodded in response. These changes had to take place at the roots.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had to erase the roots of the Nipponese Underworld step by step while simultaneously strengthening the influence of the Cathayan Underworld. After three generations, the name of the Nipponese Underworld was going to be erased from the minds of all netherworldly citizens!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"As for those who remain stubbornly devoted to the Nipponese Underworld, they'll be sent straight to the Cathayan Underworld to be reincarnated,\" Qin Changxin continued. \"Finally, we must address the Shinto religion. So long as the heritage of the Shinto religion remains, the Nipponese Underworld's deities will not die. I'll negotiate with the mortal realm to stifle the Shinto religion while promoting Taoism. Once all of these measures are implemented, it'll only be a matter of time before the netherworldly citizens of the Nipponese Underworld are assimilated.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'll leave everything to you. Aside from the governors and administrative commissioners, I give you the right to assign all other roles as you please,\" Qin Ye said. \"Setting this subject aside for now, I have something else important that I would like to discuss with you all.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A serious look appeared on his face as he continued, \"I plan to open up the Array of the Nine Gods within this year.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">None of the Yama-Kings were surprised to hear this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye continued, \"Firstly, our flying shuttles have already reached the planar walls of Limbo, so we should be able to achieve a decisive breakthrough within the next decade. In doing so, we will be taking a gigantic step, one that has never been taken in history. A new chapter in history will begin, where some small nations may experience unexpected success, while some of the four pillars may fall into decline. After we usher in the new era of space exploration, we can't control how the other underworlds choose to explore the universe. However, during the early phase of that new era, the four pillars will still be the four pillars. We need to establish a strong foundation now so that our economy can continue to be expand during the space exploration era. Only then will we have the resources required to colonize other planes and develop them. The Array of the Nine Gods has protected us for over 100 years, and it has already fulfilled its duty perfectly. Going forward, it would be more detrimental than beneficial to continue to have it in place. All it'll do is obstruct our Cathayan Underworld from communicating with the rest of the world and reduce the influx of foreign funds. The island of Formosa alone isn't enough to satisfy the entire world's appetite. During the last meeting between world leaders, I've already revealed our Cathayan Underworld's past and current state, so everyone knows that this is a land of countless opportunities.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He rose to his feet, and his beaded bracelet fell into his grasp with a flick of his wrist. \"I still haven't released the news that I plan to open up the Array of the Nine Gods. I'm sure that when I do announce it, all of the world's companies will go crazy! There's undoubtedly going to be a mad rush from international corporations to enter our nation's market, so we have to be well prepared for that.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A thought suddenly seemed to have occurred to Qin Changxin upon hearing this, and he suggested, \"Yanluo Qin, perhaps we can direct this influx toward the province of Nippon first. That way, we'll be able to give the mainland more time to prepare and react.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response with a contemplative expression. \"That's certainly a possibility. After all, if we want to fully connect our Cathayan Underworld with the rest of the world, we'll need several years to make adjustments and generate momentum. In contrast, everything in the Nipponese Underworld is already prepared, and the situation here is not much different from that in the mainland. It's also a brand new market, so foreign investors should be quite interested in it.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After discussing several important topics, Qin Ye returned to his own room. As soon as he entered the room, he caught sight of a familiar figure lounging on the sofa, drinking tea by himself.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Unannounced entry is the same as trespassing! Do you not know that?\" Qin Ye sat down across from him in a grumpy manner, then poured himself a cup of tea before taking a sip. \"What do you want now? Why are you still here? Do you want to take over Hell again? I can hand the reins back over to you right now!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo rolled his eyes in response, clearly not interested in that offer at all.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In contrast with the first King Yanluo, his two successors were far lazier in completing their jobs. If anyone was willing to accept the role of King Yanluo from them, they would immediately dump the job onto them before going into happy early retirement.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"There's only around a century left before the planar scales will be opened,\" the second King Yanluo said, wasting no time with unnecessary words.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A grim look appeared on Qin Ye's face upon hearing this, and a slightly tense atmosphere descended upon the room as he set down his teacup. \"Is the situation not looking good for us?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Not particularly, I'm afraid,\" the second King Yanluo replied as he looked up at the ceiling with an absentminded expression. \"None of you have experienced interplanar wars, so you can't imagine just how ruthless wars between races and civilizations can be. No side will rest until the other side is completely decimated.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye leaned back against the sofa as he asked, \"Are you sure you're not going to participate in this?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo shook his head in response. \"Aside from the Heavenly Dao, no one in this plane is aware of my true power, and once the interplanar wars begin, the Heavenly Dao will most definitely be going into battle as well.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Don't you think that's very boring?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No. Once the interplanar wars begin, you'll feel that those wars are very cruel. However, once you venture into the universe, you'll find that space is even crueler. Civilizations that aren't powerful enough should pray that they never step out of their planes. Once they do so, they'll leave behind traces of themselves in space, and that'll attract unimaginably powerful enemies to them.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Can't we all always rely on you if all else fails?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo shook his head in response. \"My divine nation isn't over here. My territory is already sufficiently large, and according to the rules enforced by the gods, it would be inappropriate for me to claim any more territory than I already have. All of the gods are aware that this is my home planet, so none of them would dare to attack it. However, only the truly powerful races in the universe are able to come into contact with high-end gods. The civilizations around Earth aren't even aware of the existence of high-end gods, so they naturally have no such qualms. For them, traveling through the universe is a journey of light years, whereas for us, it's nothing more than a stroll in the park that can be completed in a matter of days.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He turned to Qin Ye with a meaningful expression as he continued, \"You think that high-end gods are very far away from you, but how do you know that there are no observers on this plane sent by high-end gods?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For some reason, a chill ran down Qin Ye's spine upon hearing this, and he cleared his throat before asking in a low voice, \"Are they really here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo watched him with a half-smile and offered no response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several seconds later, he moved onto another topic. \"Seeing as you have the ambition to expand this plane, you'll encounter these challenges sooner or later. In the grand scheme of things, the underworld plane is nothing more than a village. If you can't even make it out of the village, what right do you have to make it into the city? Why should I go out of my way to protect a bunch of weaklings? The fact that I'm willing to ensure the safety of my home planet is already the biggest cheat code that you have.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was developing a headache as he asked, \"Then what if you have no choice but to get involved someday?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm open to taking on one or two beings above the Yama-King level for the sake of the plane if required.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Then what if they insist on forcing your hand?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I would just fake my own death, and things will be out of my hands,\" the second King Yanluo replied with a shrug. \"Once the planar scale is completely opened, you'll encounter more and more extraterrestrial gods. This year alone, we've already warded off three probing attacks from extraterrestrial civilizations. You have to make haste in your development. Also, I approve of opening up the Array of the Nine Gods.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, he vanished into thin air, leaving only a parting message behind. \"Make sure to prepare extensively. Once the plane is opened up, you'll face far steeper challenges than you can imagine, so you can never be over prepared.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that, the second King Yanluo was gone.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye stood on the spot with his hands clasped behind his back, and he was silent for a long while.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He didn't think that the second King Yanluo was joking.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though he hadn't interacted with the second King Yanluo much, he knew that the second King Yanluo was a very strong-minded person. He always seized the initiative and he possessed unfathomable power. If he said that he wouldn't get involved, then he would definitely follow through with that. Throughout the entire time that Qin Ye had known the second King Yanluo, he had never seen him swallow his words.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So we only have 100 years left?\" Qin Ye sighed to himself. \"That's not much time at all.\"</span></p>"

At this point, he felt like it was time. Space exploration was the ultimate objective of the entire plane.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the wooden box was opened, a string of mechanical clicks rang out, and Qin Ye was staring intently at it. He also wanted to know the biggest secret of this plane. He wanted to see who its biggest enemy and its biggest threat was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Several seconds later, the box abruptly sprang open. Right as Qin Ye was staring intently at it with full focus, a spring suddenly erupted out of the box, and on the top of the spring was the smiling face of a huge puppet. At the same time, a line of blood-red Yin energy text quickly appeared in the air: \"Surprise!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What the fuck?!\" Qin Ye immediately sprang to his feet as if he had been stabbed in the backside, and his heart was pounding like a jackhammer. Countless profanities instantly rushed to the tip of his tongue at once, and he turned to storm away in a fit of rage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Ah, Your Excellency! Where are you going?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Don't try to stop me! Ain't nobody gonna stop me today! Where's my sword? Get my sword! How many times have I told you not to misplace my sword? Find it for me right away!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency, who's gotten you so mad?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Shut up! Get the second King Yanluo to come and see me!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After over 10 minutes of vehement persuasion and consolation from Wang Chenghao, Qin Ye finally gave up on the suicidal idea of challenging the second King Yanluo to a battle to the death. After that, he returned to his office in an enraged manner, and only after massaging his own temples for a long while was he able to calm himself down.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After chugging down a cup of tea, he viciously swatted the clown's head away, revealing a dazzling sapphire lying at the bottom of the box.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the instant that the sapphire appeared, Qin Ye felt a barely detectable gaze sweep over his own body, and even he couldn't sense exactly where the gaze was coming from.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was most likely a fragment of the second King Yanluo's consciousness that he had left in the box to act as a security measure. The sapphire was giving off bursts of golden light that formed a massive screen of light in the air, depicting a vast galaxy of stars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Every single star was slowly revolving, and asteroid belts were hovering around&nbsp;of the stars. Everything was extremely beautiful and orderly. Amid this tranquil scene of ethereal beauty, the second King Yanluo's voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Earth's underworld plane is located in the seventh spiral of the Yin Space River, which is far away from the first and fourth spirals, the ones most heavily ravaged by war. Aside from Earth, none of the civilizations in this spiral are considered to be high-end civilizations.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If it weren't for that surprise from earlier, the voice would've been quite authoritative and majestic.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Remember that the space seen from the mortal realm is different from the one seen in the underworld. The mortal realm and the underworld are like two pieces of paper that run parallel to one another, never to intersect. They appear to be quite similar overall with only minute differences, such as the configuration of the stars, the distance between the planes, etc. However, these differences are enough to produce two completely different universes. However, the laws of Yin Yang non-interaction do not apply in space. The space of the mortal realm and the space of the underworld will form a strange parallel configuration with one another countless light years away. Here, I should mention that when I say countless light years away, I'm referring to a place known as the 'advanced nebula'. That is an indescribable place.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his voice trailed off, the screen blurred slightly, following which a vast image appeared amid the Yin clouds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye immediately drew a sharp breath upon seeing this. The impossibly vast space never failed to inspire awe and wonder within the beholder.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right before his eyes was a sea of asteroids that spread as far as the eyes could see in all directions, filling the entire galaxy!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were packed together extremely tightly like a wall in space, keeping out everything. All of the asteroids were clustered together seamlessly, and wisps of blue light were filtering out from behind the wall, forming ethereal bands of light that gave the entire scene an incredibly beautiful appearance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In contrast with the nearby planes, this wall was so tall and massive that its dimensions were impossible to calculate. This was because around a dozen asteroids combined were already comparable with the size of a plane, so it was as if this wall were formed by countless planes!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even Qin Ye couldn't help but be in complete awe and astonishment at the sight of it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"This place is known as the eternal corridor,\" the second King Yanluo's voice continued. \"A light year in front of the eternal corridor is where the mortal realm and the underworld come together. Beyond the eternal corridor is the advanced nebula, where only high-end civilizations exist, as well as materials that no longer exist in the outside world and spatial beasts capable of destroying entire planes. That is a place where opportunities and dangers lie hand in hand. The eternal corridor is eternally protected by a high-end civilization, first truly powerful civilization that most civilizations encounter, the snakeform race. They have already existed for 75,000 years, and they are responsible for guarding the eternal corridor.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was listening intently, and the more he heard, the more he realized just how important this information was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Firstly, it clarified to him the direction that he was supposed to develop in. It told him how they were supposed to explore or colonize nearby planes once they achieved space exploration and ventured into outer space.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The right strategy definitely wasn't to just venture blindly deeper. One could imagine that the deeper one ventured into space, the more dangerous the civilizations that they encountered would be. All of them were civilizations powerful enough to have entered the eternal corridor and set foot into the advanced nebula. Given the current power and technology of Earth, there was no way that it would be able to contend with those powerful civilizations. Thus, forging ahead blindly and recklessly would only leave a trail of breadcrumbs for those high-end civilizations to track down the underworld plane.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Dark Forest theory was only a fictional theory, but it was one that made a lot of sense.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Exploration of space was something that had to be advanced in a cyclical fashion. The underworld plane had to strengthen itself and colonize several dozen planes before it could even begin to think about venturing into the eternal corridor, and these were massive projects that would take thousands of years to complete.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to the unpredictable nature of space, every single underworld could potentially be blessed by unimaginable opportunities during this time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Small underworlds could encounter multiple planes suitable for colonization and rich in resources, thereby rapidly elevating them to become underworlds as powerful as the four pillars, while the four pillars could lose their advantage over the rest of the world simply due to a sequence of ill-fortune in their space exploration endeavors.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was truly an exciting prospect.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the four pillars refused to take this step, then they would forever reign supreme over this plane. However, in doing so, they would be reducing the underworld plane to sitting ducks for extraterrestrial planes. In a century, the planar scale was going to be opened, and they would have no choice but to face the outside world!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As opposed to waiting passively, it was naturally best to seize the initiative.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He took a few deep breaths to calm himself down, then continued listening.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo's voice continued, \"Now that you understand the structure of space, what I have to tell you next is that all underworld civilizations are born from chaos. As I'm sure you're aware by this point, prior to reaching the eternal corridor, the distance between underworld planes isn't that far. It's roughly equivalent to the distance from Earth to the moon. With two underworld civilizations located in close proximity to one another, it's very easy for them to discover each other. In order to fight for the right to survive in space, the two civilizations will inevitably have to go to war. This type of situation is not uncommon.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In reality, perhaps there was no reason for the two planes to go to war, but once again, it came down to the Dark Forest theory.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With two neighboring planes, both of which had their own civilizations, both sides would be careful not to reveal themselves, but they couldn't ensure that the other side would do the same.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What if the other plane had already forged an alliance with other planes?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What if the other plane had already completed mass migration of all of its civilizations?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one in the entire universe could be trusted or relied on aside from oneself!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, there was only one possible outcome for neighboring planes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Earth's underworld is both fortunate and also unfortunate,\" the second King Yanluo's voice continued. \"It's unfortunate in that within the same distance between Earth and the sun, there are six planes around the underworld plane, and there just so happens to be another underworld civilization among them. Furthermore, that civilization has also been in existence for over 7,000 years. However, what's fortunate is that their level of development is quite comparable to that of this plane, and they primarily prioritize strengthening their physical bodies. This will be your first extraterrestrial opponent: the canter civilization. All underworld civilizations evolved according to their corresponding mortal realm civilization. At the moment, the canter underworld possesses three major alliances. When translated into the language of Earth, they can be read as the Eye of the Thousand Hands, the Tongue of the Thousand Throats, and the Heart of the Thousand Eyes. The canter underworld has a theocratic government system, and this is a result of the constant stream of divine miracles projected by their god of creation, Ansotlini, during the past several thousand years of the plane's existence. The three major alliances were all left behind by Ansotlini, and they're split up into his body, his heart, and his spirit. Their plane has a total of three beings above the Yama-King level, placing them at the pinnacle of the underworld civilizations in the chaotic region. On top of that, they have roughly 65 Yama-Kings, as well as roughly 10% more Abyssal Prefects and Infernal Judges than on Earth. However, their overall netherworldly citizen population isn't as high as ours. Here is the information I have on their core members.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Lines of text that were accompanied by images quickly appeared on the screen of light, and Qin Ye faltered slightly upon seeing this, then discovered that he could pause and resume the procession of text and images on the screen as he pleased.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the question on his mind was why the second King Yanluo was so familiar with this plane.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to ponder this question any further, the second King Yanluo's rang out again. \"I am quite familiar with this plane because I know their god of creation, Ansotlini. He's in the advanced nebula, but he's not doing so well there. In fact, he's not even a true god.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In typical fashion of the second King Yanluo, phrases like \"he's not even a true god\" sounded extremely natural when they were spoken by him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Make sure to study this information carefully.\" The second King Yanluo's voice was beginning to fade away. \"Regardless of whether you can overcome the canter civilization or not, I'm going to leave Earth. I've already stayed here for long enough and lost interest in it. I hope to see you all again in the advanced nebula, even if that's going to be thousands of years in the future.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The screen of light slowly vanished, and Qin Ye was silent for a long time before closing the box.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a brief moment of contemplation, he opened the box again before stuffing the spring-loaded clown into it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He then cleared his throat, and Secretary Yuan immediately appeared in a wraith-like manner before extending a slight bow. \"What are your instructions, Your Excellency?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Contact the three pillars,\" Qin Ye instructed with a contemplative expression. \"Tell them that I have important news from the world's gate, and that I'm willing to share it with them.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes!\"</span></p>"

After that, the Cathayan Underworld was constantly urged to sign the treaty. After a month of constant nagging from the international community, Zhao Yun traveled to the Coalition of Underworlds in Qin Ye's stead to re-sign the treaty on the non-proliferation of forbidden arts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld was like an intricately constructed machine that was quickly returning to action after lying defunct for over a century.

At the moment, there were further experiments being conducted to see if the energy fluctuations of the second-generation forbidden arts could be used as a new energy resource. As for the space exploration project, that involved a series of other major projects, so it stood to reason that it would take longer than the second-generation forbidden arts project to complete.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to government propaganda and favorable policies, physics and chemistry had become the most popular subjects in universities, and all graduates from those departments were extremely sought after by all major companies. It was also because of this that after around a decade of development, the Hou Yi Corporation of Cathay, the Central Starcloud Corporation, and Southwest Osmanthus Moon Technologies had arisen as three major corporations in the technology field, providing a large amount of resources for the Sword Coral Research Institute.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Hou Yi Corporation specialized in the production of motors and internal combustion engines, while the Starcloud Corporation produced space shuttle casing, and Osmanthus Moon Technologies produced space exploration materials. However, in contrast with the Starcloud Corporation, they developed internal materials rather than external casings. With so much assistance available to them, those at the Sword Coral Research Institute were able to focus their attention on calculation and experimentation, which were of the utmost importance.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the moment, the three corporations were all in the red. After all, the only buyer of their products was the Sword Coral Research Institute, and that wasn't enough for them to turn a profit. However, the central government was constantly reinforcing the propaganda that the nation's ultimate goal was space exploration.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If that goal could be successfully achieved, then the future potential for growth and development for the three corporations would be unfathomable!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, even though their annual reports didn't make for good reading, all of the largest refined electronics corporations, television stations, and many materials corporations in the Cathayan Underworld were more than happy to invest in the trio of companies.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was aware that the most difficult initial stage of space exploration research and development had already been overcome. After the market opened up and a sufficient supply of skilled personnel was gathered, the research would perhaps be completed in a shorter timeframe than projected. By the time Qin Ye received the final report, it would mean that everything had already been tested and was successful.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This meant that they had already used the super astronomical telescope.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, the standard procedure would be for visual and statistical data to be sent to him, so that he would be able to examine the outcomes, then announce them to the entire nation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, no data had been sent to him, but Vice-president Li Chun had come to visit.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps they saw something when they looked into space for the first time...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, Qin Ye instructed, \"Please tell Vice-president Li to wait momentarily, I'll be with him shortly.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Soon, Qin Ye was accompanied by a secretary to the guest hall that Li Chun was situated in.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the North Yin Pavilion had already expanded to several times its original size. Aside from the central buildings that had been present from the very beginning and hadn't been rebuilt since then, all of the new buildings were extremely spacious. This was to facilitate all of the new officials that were going to visit in the future, as well as for foreign guests visiting after the opening of the Array of the Nine Gods. At the moment, Li Chun was in one of those buildings.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The secretary opened the door, and Qin Ye made his way into the room with a wide smile before shaking Li Chun's hand. \"Thank you for your hard work, Vice-president Li.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the same time, he was observing Li Chun's expression, and he discovered that Li Chun was looking very excited, but buried deep beneath that excitement was a hint of fear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They must've seen something.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't immediately begin a conversation. Instead, he instructed everyone to vacate the room, leaving only Wang Chenghao to take notes, then sat down on a chair as he said with a smile, \"I didn't think that you would complete development on the project so quickly. So? Have you already tested the telescope? What did you see?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Li Chun took a deep breath, then replied in a trembling voice, \"Your Excellency... There are other civilizations in space!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wang Chenghao almost dropped his pen upon hearing this, and he immediately raised his head to stare at Li Chun with an incredulous expression. In contrast, Qin Ye nodded calmly in response, then suddenly asked, \"How many people were present during the observation?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Li Chun didn't quite know what to make of that question. \"There were several hundred people there. Your Excellency, what are your...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm going to issue an order to contain this information. Only those who sign non-disclosure agreements can return to work on the project,\" Qin Ye said in a calm manner. \"This is a secret known only by the ruler death gods of the four pillars. Having said that, it'll be revealed to the entire world within a century, so it's not overly important.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The room fell completely silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Li Chun's mouth sprang open like a spluttering fish, and his brain was struggling to process what he had just heard.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He would never forget just how astonished everyone had been when they had seen those extraterrestrial beings through the telescope. The entire Sword Coral Research Institute had been shocked to the core, yet Qin Ye wasn't surprised, nor flustered in the slightest.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You... already knew?\" he asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye didn't answer that question. Instead, he made a gesture toward Wang Chenghao, and the latter immediately pulled out a remote control, while a display screen descended on the other side of the table.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Let's examine what you saw first.\" Qin Ye's calmness was rubbing off on Li Chun, allowing him to regain his composure and think about how to deal with these extraterrestrial civilizations. He nodded in response, then handed an optical disc over to Wang Chenghao.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Wang Chenghao departed from the room, and less than a minute later, the surrounding blinds slowly closed, plunging the room into darkness. Meanwhile, the screen slowly lit up.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The footage had been edited so that no sound could be heard, but a dazzling starry sky could be seen.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The image was a little shaky, but it was very clear. Soon, the shakiness also abated, and it seemed that the adjustments of the recording device had been completed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This wasn't the first time that Qin Ye had seen outer space, but on this occasion, he was far more relaxed, allowing him to more carefully observe what he was seeing in greater detail.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could see that the stars were larger and greater in number in the space of the underworld than that of the mortal realm. Just as the second King Yanluo had said, the distance between realms was shorter, and they were more tightly packed together than in the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, he couldn't see any extraterrestrial civilization.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the image swiveled around toward another direction, immediately following which the recording device began to shake violently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the image stabilized, Qin Ye couldn't help but draw a sharp breath, even though he was already mentally prepared.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Outside the underworld plane, eight planes had linked themselves together in a series, and at the furthest point was a vast black hole!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The black hole was massive, comparable in size with the sun, and just as Qin Ye was carefully observing it, Li Chun explained in a grim voice, \"This is a black hole, but also not a black hole. It has the appearance of a black hole, but it doesn't possess any characteristics of a black hole. Please direct your attention here.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He pressed the pause button before pointing at a certain spot on the image.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a closer look to discover an asteroid belt around the black hole.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was definitely not normal.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If this were a real black hole, then it would be impossible for an asteroid belt to exist around it! Nothing could remain in such close proximity to a black hole!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We refer to it as the Eye of the North Star,\" Li Chun said.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just as he was about to continue, Qin Ye raised a hand to cut him off. \"There's no need to go into any technical explanations, just tell me what you think it is.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Li Chun was silent for a moment before replying, \"We think it's a gate, but we don't know where it could lead to. There shouldn't be much difference between the spatial vectors and rate of passage of time between our side and the other side, and that's why this black-hole-like phenomenon exists. It shouldn't possess any suction force, but it's very difficult to say that for sure. We think that it's exactly because of the existence of this Eye of the North Star that this extremely rare phenomenon of nine connected stars has emerged. Also, this isn't the most important point.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He picked up the remote control and switched through several images. As the final image appeared, a hint of killing intent flashed through Qin Ye's eyes, and Li Chun's hands also began to tremble slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was a hovering rhomboid structure presented in the image!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It definitely wasn't a naturally forming structure. Its surface was extremely smooth and riddled with pits and bumps, all of which were clearly spaced out in an orderly fashion, so it was quite obvious that this was an artificial structure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The structure was hovering above a plane, and it wasn't situated very high up, but what was certain was that it was already in space. Furthermore, there were countless weightless materials beneath it, and they seemed to have been strung up into a chain by an invisible rope, connected directly to the rhomboid structure from the plane down below.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a full minute of silence did Qin Ye ask, \"Is that the only one?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Li Chun nodded in response. \"At the moment, we've only discovered that one. Truth be told, the super astronomical telescope was already completed a week ago, but in order to verify this structure, we observed it from several dozen different angles at countless different points in time. As a result, we discovered that the structure has an estimated surface area of over two million square kilometers, and construction on it should be completed within the next 60 years!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A grim look appeared on Qin Ye's face upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn't stunned by the space exploration technology that he was witnessing. In reality, during his first observation of space through the telescope constructed from the body of the fifth sun god, he had already discovered that the extraterrestrial civilizations were only more advanced in their space exploration technology than the underworld plane was.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What was he stunned by was the fact that they had already begun attempting to assemble their space fortress after only several decades since then!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">While it was true that Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa also had a space fortress, their one had been constructed in the plane and was to be launched in the future, yet this space fortress was being directly constructed in space.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even Qin Ye couldn't help but feel a little unsettled upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Prior to launching the Cathayan Underworld's space fortress, no one could be sure of whether it would actually be able to reach space, even if the inner demon's body were capable of warding off astral winds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Was research in the underworld plane progressing in the wrong direction?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Otherwise, why would an extraterrestrial plane with more advanced space exploration technology choose to construct their space fortress in space instead?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Alternatively, could it be that their choice was the more correct one?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Another possibility was that the space fortresses being constructed by the two planes were simply different things entirely. After all, a space fortress with a surface area of several million square kilometers could already be referred to as a space station.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Leave the data with me, and you can go back for now,\" Qin Ye finally said. \"Don't make a fuss out of this, and make sure none of the people privy to this information spread it to the outside world. At the same time, tell them that we are already aware of the situation and have prepared countermeasures against it.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yes.\" Thus, Li Chun departed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye stared at the image of the rhomboid structure for a long while before finally heaving a faint sigh.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Immediately thereafter, he made a grabbing motion, and a black box appeared in his grasp before being placed onto the table with the utmost care.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's finally time for you to be opened...\"</span></p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no reason for the three pillars to turn down the Cathayan Underworld's invitation, but the location of the meeting was naturally set at the headquarters of the Coalition of Underworlds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Half a month later, the ruler death gods of the four pillars were gathered in a conference hall of the highest caliber. Information regarding the world's gate was about to be shared, and no outsiders could be allowed to hear it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The styles of the four pillars were very pronounced in this conference hall, and at its center was a massive round table. This was the private conference hall of the four pillars. Beyond the Coalition of Underworlds, the Six Eyes Conference, and other international organizations, there was an organization of an even higher level, one that could only be joined by the four pillars, and that was the Coalition of Rulers.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the conference hall for the Coalition of Rulers, and under normal circumstances, it could easily go decades, perhaps even centuries without ever hosting a meeting. However, every time it was opened, there was definitely a major event afoot.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ruler death gods of the four pillars pressed their palms against the locking mechanism at the entrance in unison, and the doors of the conference hall swung open, following which all of the Yin soldiers behind them extended respectful bows.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was not a single Yin spirit in the hall, not even any recorders or servants. The only ones in here were the four most powerful ruler death gods of the underworld, and after taking a sip of tea, Yamaraja smiled and said, \"This is the first time you've initiated a meeting between the Coalition of Rulers, Yanluo Qin. I hear that you would like to present some news regarding the world's gate?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's right,\" Qin Ye replied as he set down his teacup. \"However, prior to that, I have to raise something that's been quite perplexing to me. Even though I inherited the black box, it was passed down to me by the second King Yanluo, so everything was viewed through his perspective. As such, it's not a true record of history, and he didn't detail the history of the world's gate, nor the main distribution of forces in there.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Those aren't secrets to the ruler death gods of the four pillars,\" Anubis replied. \"You can find answers to all of those questions in this very room.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was no animosity or tension at all between the four ruler death gods on this occasion. After all, the four pillars were on a united front when it came to the world's gate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Do you know what's behind here, Yanluo Qin?\" Anubis asked as he casually indicated around the hall. There were no windows in the hall. Instead, the entire room was completely sealed, and abstract reliefs of death gods were carved onto the walls. The reliefs mostly depicted what humans imagined death gods to look at, so there was quite a large disparity between their appearance and the appearances of actual death gods.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Without waiting for a reply from Qin Ye, Thanatos gently flicked a finger through the air, and a burst of Yin energy was sent flying out. Immediately thereafter, a string of mechanical clicks rang out all around them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye turned around with a curious expression, and in the next instant, all of the surrounding walls rose up in unison to reveal a giant skeleton.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye stood up from his chair before making his way over to the skeleton, then began to carefully inspect it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was an enormous skeleton. This conference hall had a radius around 10 meters, and the skeleton spanned the length of almost the entire wall, so it had to have been at least 50 meters in length. Furthermore, it didn't belong to a human!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye made his way around the room, and upon seeing the skeleton's lizard-like skull and giant bone wings, as well as its long tail bone, he raised an eyebrow as he asked, \"Is this a dragon? A western dragon?\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, his brows then immediately furrowed tightly as he approached the skeleton and looked carefully at its bone wings. \"Hold on, this is a bone dragon? One that's at the Yama-King level?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Oh? What makes you say that?\" Thanatos asked with a smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye pointed at the skeleton's wings as he replied, \"These bone wings. If this is the skeleton of a normal giant dragon, the wings of its bones would only form an outline because the wings of normal giant dragons are predominantly formed by flesh. In contrast, there's a membrane growing from the bone wings of this dragon.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He reached out to stroke the skeleton's wings, then continued, \"The membrane is very thin and also very brittle, but that's only because no Yama-King level Yin energy has been injected into it. With an influx of Yama-King level Yin energy, the wings should be able to support it on short-distance flights through space.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ruler death gods of the three pillars nodded in unison. As for how Qin Ye was able to identify the creature as a Yama-King level being, that was a question that didn't need to be asked. Death gods could always sense other death gods, even in the form of remains.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So it really did come from space?\" Qin Ye asked as he turned around to face the three ruler death gods.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your observation skills are as sharp as ever, Yanluo Qin,\" Yamaraja replied with a smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He then pointed at a certain part of the giant dragon's bone wings as he continued, \"That is indeed the case.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the direction that he was pointing toward, there was a slightly charred section on the giant dragon's wings. That could've only been the result of flying through the atmosphere. Otherwise, nothing would've been able to harm the body of a Yama-King.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So it came from another plane all the way to our underworld?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It failed to anticipate that this world isn't weaker than its home world,\" Anubis said. \"We immediately sensed it as soon as it entered our world, and that was 500 years ago. It was very fortunate in that it landed in the Australis Underworld. At the time, the Australis Underworld was only inhabited by a bunch of Aboriginal Yin spirits who didn't know how to cultivate at all, so it thought that it was invincible in this world. While we were still observing it, it had already taken over the entire Australis Underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response as an enlightened look appeared on his face.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only with people could there be faith, and only with faith could a religion arise.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the Australis Continent, the Aboriginal population was originally very spread-out. Only in 1770, when the Britannian voyager Captain Cook discovered the east coast of Australis, which he named New South Wales, was the continent of Australis declared to be a colony of Britannia.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, Australis became a place for Britannia to ship its convicts off to.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the 18th of January, 1788, Captain Philips arrived with a fleet of six ships carrying 1,530 passengers at Botany Bay of Australis. This fleet was known as the First Fleet. 736 of the crew members were convicts, and they were eternally banished to Australis. Eight days later, they officially established the first Britannian colony at Jackson Bay, which later went on to become the number one city in Australis, Sydney.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the time, the Aboriginal population was still at a hunter-gatherer stage of society. There were over 500 tribes, and there was already a considerable population of over 750,000, but they were spread out far and wide.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of the Britannian colonizers, the Aboriginal population had no advantages to speak of. At the time, Britannia was at the height of its powers. As time passed, more and more of the Aboriginal population was wiped out until the nation's population consisted almost exclusively of only Caucasian Britannians.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was why Australis was in a tropical region of the world, but their people were completely different in appearance from those in the nations around them, including the nearby islanders and the Indonesian. Otherwise, it would've been impossible for Caucasians to have appeared in places with that type of climate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This death god was extremely fortunate in that it had arrived on perhaps the most vulnerable continent in the entire underworld plane. Without a true death god like the Plumed Serpent God present on the continent, the probability of Mythic Spirits emerging were downright negligible, so as an extraterrestrial death god, it automatically became the most powerful being on the entire continent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, it was naive enough to believe that the entire world was in the same state as the Australis Underworld, and it was no surprise that this false assumption led to its eventual demise.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is this why the world's gate was established?\" Qin Ye asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's part of it,\" Yamaraja replied. \"Back then, it was I who confronted the creature. It was a mid Yama-King, so the battle didn't take long at all. However, right before its death, it unleashed some type of ability similar to a bloodline curse. We've never managed to gather much information on the plane that it came from. This ability allowed a wisp of its soul to escape, and its spiritual energy spread to all parts of the Australis Underworld, making it no longer suitable for netherworldly citizen habitation.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How is that possible?\" Qin Ye asked as his brows furrowed slightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even the more powerful external force would eventually be assimilated by the planet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even radiation from nuclear bombs would eventually clear up after several decades, and it had already been several centuries since the incident on the continent of Australis.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It became an anchor point,\" Anubis explained. \"The entire Australis Underworld was corrupted by the power of that extraterrestrial god, forming a giant rune that we are unable to erase. Once you enter the world's gate, you'll constantly hear the voice of a death god, and all beings at or below the Abyssal Prefect level that enter the world's gate will perish without any exceptions! Care to guess what the voice says?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A contemplative look appeared on Qin Ye's face, following which a harrowing thought surfaced in his mind. \"Could it be the coordinates of our underworld plane?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"As expected of someone of your intellect, Yanluo Qin,\" Thanatos said with a cold smile. \"Indeed, that's exactly what it is. Through the Australis Underworld, it's been constantly transmitting the coordinates of our plane into outer space. Prior to 200 years ago, we hadn't seen any extraterrestrial gods aside from this one. But recently, starting from around 160 years ago, to be exact, we clearly felt five or six instances of extraterrestrial gods inspecting our plane.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This meant that after a span of over 300 years, its message had reached its home plane, and the other death gods from that plane had arrived!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye fell into deep thought upon hearing this. This was a lot of information, and it once again confirmed the fact that the other plane was extremely advanced when it came to space exploration, leading Earth's underworld plane by at least 500 years!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">500 years ago, the skeletal dragon had to have been a part of the canter underworld's first attempt at extraterrestrial exploration, and the reason for that was very simple: Yama-Kings would've only been used for the initial forays into outer space.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even Yama-Kings couldn't fly for long distances in space, but they had to scout out the unknown. Only by sending out scouts would they be able to gather information on the universe, thereby allowing them to map out where they were supposed to go next. However, this skeletal dragon was quite unfortunate. There was no way that they could've anticipated that there would be two almost evenly matched underworld civilizations in the same star system.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the beginning, sending out Yama-Kings as scouts was the most economical and appropriate course of action. In contrast, it would be far more idiotic to invest massive amounts of resources into constructing a space fortress, then wandering aimlessly through space without any purpose or direction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I see.\" Qin Ye returned to his seat, then reached out to push the black box across the table. \"Take a look, everyone. This is the opponent that we'll have to face and the amount of time that we have left.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A 500-year lead in space exploration was a very terrifying prospect, but it wasn't completely decisive because the second King Yanluo had revealed through this message that the other plane didn't possess any forbidden arts.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nuclear weaponry was going to be their final trump card!</span></p>"

He couldn't help but reminisce about his first visit to the new continent. At the time, he had taken extreme caution not to be detected, yet now, he was able to blatantly make the journey, and no one would dare to stop him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had already achieved everything that he could in Earth's underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Granted, the Cathayan Underworld still wasn't the most powerful underworld. In the wake of the fall of the old Hell, several thousand years worth of netherworldly citizens, skilled personnel, and accumulated wealth and resources had been lost. However, the current Cathayan Underworld already had the right to lead the world forward once again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even looking back now, some of the choices that he had made were still quite harrowing to him. However, it was only due to those bold gambles and all types of fortunate circumstances that he was in his current position, able to fly over the Atlantic Ocean with reckless abandon, rather than cowering in the second King Yanluo's array like a scared kitten.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If Zhao Yun hadn't transcended beyond the Yama-King level by a stroke of luck, Qin Ye would've been completely at the mercy of the three pillars during the conference in Nara, allowing them to levy whatever sanctions they wanted against him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If it weren't for that conference in Nara, they wouldn't have been able to recruit their first allies in the form of the five Northern Europa nations and the Mythic Spirits of the Alkebulan Underworlds, nor would they have been able to initiate the new energy resource revolution.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If he hadn't made a seemingly reckless move by dedicating the entire nation's resources into developing the new energy resource, the Cathayan Underworld would've been stagnant for much longer.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the steps that he had taken had finally brought him to a point where the entire world was willing to come together and set aside their differences, and only then did the Cathayan Underworld earn itself the right to be the world's leader.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As these thoughts were flashing through his mind, the enormous Xolotl's Screen had already appeared up ahead, and all of the guards on the screen were on high alert at the sight of the cloud of Yin energy speeding over the surface of the sea. By the time Qin Ye drew to a halt in front of the screen, countless Eagle Warriors had already raised their crimson shields, while the massive Eye of Xolotl had risen up behind them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Yanluo Qin.\" Xolotl's indifferent voice rang out from behind the screen. \"I didn't receive any advance notice of your visit, so you are trespassing on another nation's territorial sea.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face. He no longer had any qualms facing death gods of Xolotl's caliber. The only beings in this world who could speak to him as equals were ruler death gods who were also advanced Yama-Kings.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xolotl wasn't happy to see him here because there was a natural conflict of interest between them. He didn't know what Qin Ye's intentions were, so he was under the opinion that Qin Ye was helping Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa to extend their lifespans. Little did he know that this wasn't even Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa's objective anymore.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We just held a meeting between the Coalition of Rulers. I'm sure you know what that is,\" Qin Ye said. \"The content that was discussed during the meeting is extremely important, and I must relay it to Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa in person. At the same time, prior to coming here, I already instructed our foreign affairs department to send a message to the new continent's foreign affairs departments, and this is a private visit from me. Did you not hear about this? I didn't know that the new continent's government was so inefficient. Could it be that no central government even exists anymore on the new continent?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In a massive Aztec-style temple behind the screen, Xolotl's expression instantly darkened significantly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He certainly didn't enjoy being spoken to in such a condescending tone. He had naturally already received notification from the foreign affairs department, but he didn't want to allow Qin Ye into the new continent again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was their continent! Once Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa perished, he and the other death gods would be the rightful heirs! With that in mind, he was naturally very reluctant to see anyone attempt to extend Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa's lifespans.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Furthermore, Qin Ye was clearly looking down on him.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That final question about whether a central government still existed on the new continent seemed to be a joke, but it was actually a threat. According to international regulation, once a nation had no central government, then the Coalition of Underworlds would have the right to deploy troops to that nation to maintain stability there.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What does it matter to you if we have a central government or not?

I'll immediately contact the foreign affairs department for verification. Prior to that, I must fulfill my duties, so please wait here momentarily, Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His plan was to embarrass Qin Ye by making him wait for several hours in a foreign territorial sea.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could simply blame this on a miscommunication from the foreign affairs department, and there would be no way to verify whether that was true or not. In any case, the blame would fall upon the foreign affairs department, and he wouldn't be held accountable anyway.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Outside Xolotl's Screen, Qin Ye's eyes narrowed slightly as he said in a cold voice, \"Death God Xolotl, are you refusing a mandate from the meeting between the Coalition of Rulers or are you refusing entry to the Cathayan Underworld's King Yanluo?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I am simply performing my duty,\" Xolotl replied. \"Let me reiterate that without prior notice, your arrival here will be seen as trespassing upon the territory of the new continent, which can be viewed as an act of war. Do you intend to instigate a war against the new continent just like you did with the Nipponese Underworld?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As he was speaking, all of the Yin soldiers on the city wall lowered the tips of their spears, aiming them directly toward Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, the sound of a cane thudding onto the ground suddenly rang out from outside the temple, and Xolotl faltered slightly upon hearing this sound before immediately turning around.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Yin soldiers on either side of the temple's entrance had already sprawled onto the ground on all-fours, and standing between them was a short and wizened figure.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The figure had a hunched back and was wearing Aztec-style attire that was teeming with feathers, as well as heavy gold accessories. Her wizened face was riddled with liver spots, and she wore a half smile as she gently massaged the human bone necklace in her hand while staring intently at Xolotl.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A sense of foreboding instantly welled up in Xolotl's heart, and he was scarcely able to believe his own eyes. The Yin energy behind the figure was as vast as smoke, and just being in her presence alone made him feel as if there were a sword hanging above his head, threatening to take his life at any moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was Mictetikasiwa!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why is she here?!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, an application for a diplomatic visit from the Cathayan Underworld would definitely have been submitted to Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa by the foreign affairs department, but weren't they already insane? Why were they still interested in meeting the ruler death god of another nation? And how had she arrived here so quickly?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xolotl's throat instantly ran dry as he greeted in a hoarse voice, \"Your Excellency...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of a sudden, Mictetikasiwa's Yin energy erupted forth violently, and all of the lights in the entire temple were instantly destroyed. Her inky-black Yin energy formed a boundless realm of death within which countless Yin spirits were howling and weeping incessantly. Inside this domain of death, Mictetikasiwa finally began to move, making her way toward Xolotl one step after another.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her footsteps were completely silent, but with each step she took, Xolotl felt as if his heart were being trampled under the feet of a giant.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After just a few steps, Xolotl's legs had already given out from under him, and he scrambled down from his throne before collapsing to the ground in a horrified manner.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His soul was trembling violently, and his heart was filled with fear. Finally, he saw a pair of feet draw to a halt in front of him, following which what felt like a terrifying beast leaned down to observe him in silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, he felt like a defenseless bunny being scrutinized by a dragon!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the face of what was clearly a higher life form, he could only grit his teeth with all his might. He wanted to say something, but was unable to say anything, and in the end, he was only able to force out a hoarse greeting in a trembling voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I didn't know that you had the right to intercept a ruler death god of one of the four pillars,\" Mictetikasiwa said in a cold voice.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No, I...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I didn't know that the central government had already become so inefficient.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Your Excellency...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had a chance to finish, Mictetikasiwa slammed her cane down onto the ground, and a visible shockwave swept through the entire temple. Xolotl immediately fell silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Xolotl.\" Mictetikasiwa stood up straight as she said, \"Your brother, the Plumed Serpent God, betrayed the plane, yet we still allowed you to continue overseeing Xolotl's Screen, and that is a sign of our faith in you. Do you think that without Xolotl's Eye, we won't be able to effectively defend our territorial sea? Ah Puch and Supay have been eyeing your position for a very long time. You are the only one with a legitimate excuse to gather an army so that you can fight for our position after we pass away.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I...\" Xolotl was just about to say something, but Mictetikasiwa's Yin energy instantly enveloped his entire body like a cocoon.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Did I allow you to speak?\" Mictetikasiwa asked in a voice that was brimming with cold killing intent. \"Don't try to deny it, we know that you're all waiting for our deaths. At least five of the world's top 10 consortiums have invested in you, so you're clearly the most hopeful candidate in their eyes. Unfortunately, they don't know anything. I can tolerate the army that you're gathering here, and I can even tolerate your insubordination. After all, we will be leaving this plane soon, and it's time that we handed over the reins to the three of you. However, you've become too conceited, to the point that you think you're already the ruler of this continent, that you can communicate as equals with the ruler death god of one of the four pillars. You're still not an advanced death god yet, Xolotl.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xolotl raised his head in an incredulous manner upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Isn't she supposed to be insane? Why is she still so reasoned and logical? This doesn't make sense!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could see that Mictetikasiwa's eyes were completely clear and lucid without any hint of insanity in them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A terrifying thought surfaced in his mind, yet just as he was about to say something, Mictetikasiwa slammed her cane onto the ground again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, Xolotl vanished on the spot before he even had a chance to cry out.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only then did Mictetikasiwa turn around as she put on her most welcoming smile. Her voice wasn't very loud, but it was clearly audible along the entire length of Xolotl's Screen. \"Open the gate and organize a welcome of the highest caliber for the Cathayan Underworld's King Yanluo!\"</span></p>"

At the same time, a welcoming party dressed in colorful attire emerged from the gate in a uniform fashion, blowing on trumpets as they emerged.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye raised an eyebrow in a surprised manner upon seeing this. He didn't think that Xolotl would change his mind so quickly, and he had even considered adopting his identity as Dax to travel to the Caribbean Sea, but things had suddenly taken an unexpected turn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at the center of the welcoming party, Mictetikasiwa slowly emerged with her cane. In front of her was a ship that was entirely constructed from gold, and she stepped onto the ship before it sailed toward Qin Ye.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Long time no see, Yanluo Qin.\" After Qin Ye arrived on the golden ship, she poured him a cup of coffee. \"I apologize on behalf of Xolotl for his insolence. I hope that you may forgive him for his transgressions on the basis of our long and fruitful friendship.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"It's alright, I'm not bothered,\" Qin Ye replied with a smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had always been said that the Aztec civilization was one where gold was vastly abundant, and that was certainly on full display here. Even the tables and chairs on the ship were constructed from pure gold. In addition to that, due to the massive amount of gold production from the new continent underworld, their craftsmanship was also the best in the world, and every single carving on the ship was extremely intricate and beautiful to behold.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mictetikasiwa took a sip of coffee with a smile, then set it down before heaving a faint sigh. \"There are always some death gods who don't know their place. Even among death gods, there's a hierarchy. I am sincerely thankful for your graciousness. May I ask why you've come to our new continent in person?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's smile faded as he inspected his surroundings, and Mictetikasiwa assured him with a smile, \"This is a safe place.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response, then looked directly into her eyes as he asked, \"What stage has your space fortress progressed to?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A serious look also appeared on Mictetikasiwa's face as she replied, \"Everything has been assembled, but...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"But you discovered something unexpected through your super astronomical telescope, right?\" Qin Ye interjected. \"You discovered the nine connected stars and that massive rhomboid space station, right?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mictetikasiwa nodded in response as she heaved a faint sigh. \"It's been another few decades since our last meeting. Truth be told, the Omeyocan fortress was already ready to take off as far back as 10 years ago. The fact that you know what's going on in space tells me that the Cathayan Underworld's super astronomical telescope has also been completed, and you've come to the new continent now, so I presume that assembly of your telescope was only completed no more than a year ago.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this moment, Mictetikasiwa was displaying no signs of insanity at all. Instead, she was as cold and calculating as anyone as she continued, \"We actually already discovered the nine connected stars eight years ago. We are the first underworld to have made this discovery, but we didn't announce it to the world. In the beginning, it was only a case of random movement from the nine planes in our star system, and we couldn't be sure of exactly what was happening. Only after running calculations for two years were we finally able to confirm that if the nine planes were to continue on their original trajectories, then they would all form a line after a few decades!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye's eyes narrowed slightly upon hearing this. The second King Yanluo hadn't discussed this subject in detail through the black box, but the danger behind this phenomenon was very apparent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The canter underworld was situated at the center, and it would use all of the planes ahead of it as outposts to shift the battlefield to the forefront! If their underworld wanted to strike back at the canter underworld, then it would have to break through a series of blockades first.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a deep breath, then cast his gaze toward Mictetikasiwa before asking, \"Do you still plan to go to space?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mictetikasiwa didn't reply. Instead, she looked back at Qin Ye and asked, \"So what exactly was discussed during the meeting between the four pillars?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This wasn't the time to be playing mind games. In the face of the upcoming crisis, all of the underworlds had to unite as one on the same front, so Qin Ye revealed the content discussed during the meeting in its entirety without any hesitation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after close to a minute had passed did Mictetikasiwa's eyes narrow slightly as she asked, \"So you want us to pause our space exploration plan for now and participate in the interplanar war in 100 years?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's right,\" Qin Ye replied in an earnest voice. \"This is a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties. If you go into space now, there's no way you'll be able to bypass the blockades of the canter underworld, seeing as they have three beings above the Yama-King level. Hence, it would be nothing short of a suicide mission.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mictetikasiwa didn't reply as she picked up her cup of coffee before taking a sip.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She understood what Qin Ye was saying, and the reasons he had outlined were the same ones that had led to the temporary discontinuation of the Omeyocan plan. The enemy had already begun setting up their blockade, and if they were to venture into space now, it would essentially be the power of a nation pitted against an entire plane, and Earth's underworld wouldn't be able to provide them with any reinforcements.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the very least, they couldn't at this point in time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Also, if you leave now, what will become of the new continent under the other death gods in your absence? In Xolotl's actions today, I'm sure you can see what the future of the new continent will be like. Truth be told, during the meeting, the three pillars already raised the issue of the new continent, and I took it upon myself to pay you two a visit.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Everyone thinks that what they're seeing is reality, but that's far from the truth,\" Mictetikasiwa sighed.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's not important.\" Qin Ye leaned forward slightly as he looked directly into Mictetikasiwa's eyes. \"What the four pillars need is a peaceful new continent, an ally that we don't have to worry about. Once the interplanar war begins, the battlefield will most likely be our plane. When that time comes, the entire underworld will be ravaged by war, and we don't want to see any underworlds conquered by the enemy due to internal problems, thereby allowing the enemy to stake a foothold on our plane.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mictetikasiwa was silent for a long while.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ever since they discovered the nine connected stars, they had been preparing countermeasures, and they already had their own answer.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What do you plan to do?\" Mictetikasiwa asked in a calm voice. \"Do you want us to make the entire Omeyocan plan publicly available? That's not out of the question, but we need you to promise us one thing.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I'm listening.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We need a written promise from all underworlds not to spread their religions in all of the planes that we colonize for the next 5,000 years!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa were turning to space because their religion was about to collapse. The colonization war on the new continent in the mortal realm had decimated all of the new continent's original religions, so staying on Earth would only lead to certain death for them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By preventing all other underworlds from spreading their religions in the planes that Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa colonized for the next 5,000 years, their intention was to develop a new population of followers of the new continent's three major religions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they could win the interplanar war, then this opportunity would arise, but under the circumstances where the entire underworld would be colonizing new planes and extending their influence out into space, Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa had to re-establish their own religions, which placed them at an inherent disadvantage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye couldn't help but heave an internal sigh.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Who could've anticipated that the three religions of the new continent, which had been such a powerful force for several thousand years, would fall behind every other religion in the upcoming new chapter of history?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Due to this inherent disadvantage, the new continent would perhaps never be able to join the ranks of the four pillars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Also, we need a promise from the Cathayan Underworld,\" Mictetikasiwa continued. \"From this day forth, the new continent will become the Cathayan Underworld's eternal strategic cooperative partner.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye raised an eyebrow upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It seemed that Mictetikasiwa had also thought of everything he already had. Given the blockade that was present in space, the only thing that they could do was unite the entire underworld and fight for their lives, even if doing so would make them fall behind all of the other underworlds once the era of space exploration was ushered in.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus, they required a guarantee from the Cathayan Underworld, which had limitless potential.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Alright, I accept your condition.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Good. After our agreement is officially signed, we'll publicize all of the details and statistics pertaining to the Omeyocan plan,\" Mictetikasiwa said with a smile. \"Now then, tell me exactly what you plan to do.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye made a grabbing motion, and a document fell into Mictetikasiwa's grasp.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Genesis plan?\" Mictetikasiwa looked up from the document with a faint smile. \"What an ambitious name this is.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The room fell silent, and Mictetikasiwa continued reading. However, she had only taken a quick glance at the plan before she shuddered noticeably, then abruptly looked up to stare at Qin Ye with an incredulous expression, to which Qin Ye looked back at her with a smile.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a long while did Mictetikasiwa take a deep breath, then said, \"I take back what I just said. This isn't an ambitious name, it's extremely fitting considering what you're aiming to achieve.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye made an inviting hand gesture, urging Mictetikasiwa to read the rest of the document.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mictetikasiwa carefully read through the document in silence, and only after over an hour had passed did she close the document with mixed emotions in her eyes.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instead of immediately commenting on the plan, she closed her eyes in contemplation for a further half-hour before reopening her eyes. \"Looks like I made the correct decision to request the establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership. If you can succeed, the four pillars will be immortalized in history!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That's why the other three pillars will definitely go along with this plan,\" Qin Ye said as he locked onto Mictetikasiwa with an intense gaze. \"Also, it's not a matter of 'if' we succeed or not, our success is certain!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A thought occurred to Mictetikasiwa upon hearing this. \"You don't mean...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I said this before: prior to entering this interplanar war, we need absolute unity. You're not the only ones who'll be revealing their secrets, we'll be doing the same as well! We need all of the underworlds in this entire plane to advance and develop together! An interplanar war is not something that the four pillars alone can take on,\" Qin Ye said with a serious expression. \"If any underworlds refuse to cooperate...\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice trailed off here, and he didn't finish his sentence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A chill ran down Mictetikasiwa's spine as she asked, \"Death God?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, she wasn't referring to the cultivation rank.

However, in the instant that the box was opened, a giant clown's head sprang out amid a sharp scream, and at the same time, the word \"Surprise!\" was spelled out in large crimson text in mid-air.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"!!!\" Thanatos was so frightened that he sprang to his feet as if he had been electrocuted.

What a thoughtful present this is from the second King Yanluo.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye made an inviting hand gesture as a fake smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With an injection of Yin energy, the light screen depicting the starry sky appeared once again, and as the second King Yanluo's voice rang out, all of the death gods listened intently.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The message that Qin Ye had heard earlier was delivered once again, and only after a full 20 minutes had passed did the light screen gradually fade, upon which the conference hall fell silent again.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ruler death gods of the three pillars had all fallen into deep thought, and after a long while, Yamaraja asked, \"What do you suggest?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye rose to his feet in response. It had already been half a month since he had seen the canter underworld, and during this time, the Cathayan Underworld's panel of advisors had already provided their answer. Thus, he was far better prepared than the ruler death gods of the three pillars, who had only just seen this message.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We only have 100 years. After that, we are going to face a devastating war. If I were a death god of the canter underworld, I would definitely choose to initiate this war in Earth's underworld.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the death gods nodded in response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was very normal. War was undoubtedly going to cause widespread damage, so if the battlefield could be set as the enemy's plane, then that damage would only be inflicted upon them, while one's own plane would remain unharmed, allowing them to constantly send more reinforcements to join in on the war.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Hence, the first thing that we have to do is burst through the canter underworld's blockade. I'm not sure if all of you noticed that rhomboid fortress. That is perhaps their space fortress, and if that's the case, then they're already beginning to prepare for this war! When the time comes, we'll inevitably have to face attacks from their planar siege weapons. Just the four pillars alone won't be enough to defend the underworld. We must protect every single inch of our territory with everything in our power!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just because the four pillars could defend themselves didn't mean that the other underworlds would be able to do the same. If an underworld were to be conquered, then that would become a target for the enemy to descend, and the battlefield would well and truly become Earth's underworld!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So?\" Thanatos's brows furrowed slightly. Everyone understood what had to be done, but that didn't make the task any easier.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if they were willing to share all of their Yin runology and cultivation expertise to the rest of the world, how much would they be able to develop in just 100 years?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"So, it's time for us to truly fulfill our duties as the four pillars!\" Qin Ye rose to his feet, and among the ruler death gods of the four pillars, he wasn't particularly tall, but he was standing like a mountain at this moment. Even the other three ruler death gods were sensing an unprecedented aura from their younger counterpart.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The aura stemmed from the determination to sweep aside all opposition in the universe, and to usher in a brand new era!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye pressed his palms against the surface of the table as he looked around like a prowling tiger. \"I genuinely hope that you can all support me in this cause. We only have 100 years left, and during this time, the enemy plane is doing everything in its power to prepare for the upcoming war. This is not something that we can hide from the world for any longer!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before any of the other three ruler death gods had a chance to say anything, he continued, \"Not only can we not hide this any longer, we have to make it public knowledge! I'm not talking about only revealing the existence of the world's gate, I'm talking about making all information publicly available, including information pertaining to advanced technologies, arts, and even forbidden arts!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one said anything, but no one turned down this proposal, either.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ruler death gods of the three pillars weren't idiots. They all knew that if they could break through the canter underworld and venture into space, a brand new world would be opened up to them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At that point, things like technology, Yin runes, and resources would no longer be important. All of the underworlds could explore different directions, and all of the civilizations could welcome brand new developments, perhaps even leading to the rise of more death gods!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As one plane was conquered after another and assimilated into Earth's culture, the rise of brand new myths and legends would be inevitable. In the 1,000 years after that, there would most likely be a massive increase in the number of death gods in all civilizations!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Is the information reliable?\" Yamaraja asked.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We've all heard it just now, so why should there be any doubts?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What do you propose?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye took a deep breath, then made a grabbing motion to conjure up a stack of documents out of mid-air, which he sent flying into the hands of the three ruler death gods with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The three ruler death gods began to read through the documents, and Thanatos's eyes narrowed slightly as he mused, \"The Genesis plan? What an ambitious name.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face. \"Regardless of whether we succeed or fail, our plane will be born anew, so I think the name is very apt.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one rebuked this statement, and the trio of ruler death gods began to carefully read through the plan. The more they read, the brighter their eyes became, and on several occasions, they were unable to stop themselves from gasping at what they were seeing. Only after a full hour had passed did they close the documents, only to close their eyes in unison as if they were still reeling from what they had just read.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"That was truly unexpected.\" Thanatos was the first one to open his eyes, and he turned to Qin Ye with an intense gaze. \"This is a project the magnitude of which the underworld has never seen. If it succeeds and we win, then your achievements will at least be able to match those of the first King Yanluo!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For any nation, the founder's achievements could never be surpassed by their successors, but the ruler death gods of the three pillars felt like an exception could be made here.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"However, your Cathayan Underworld is still the main beneficiary of this plan,\" Anubis remarked. \"If we do as you say, then the Cathayan Underworld will be able to replenish its losses with the entire world's resources, and you'll be able to return to your former glory in the next century. How will we stand to benefit from that?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye looked directly into his eyes and replied, \"I don't think there's any need for us to continue bickering and competing with one another in this plane.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His words weren't very flattering, but they were definitely reasonable.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The outside world is infinitely large. How many times have we bickered and quarreled over who gets to secure more interests on this small planet? Are you not embarrassed when you think back to all of that? If we can venture out into space, there will be peace between us for at least the next several thousand years. In fact, we could even become the closest of allies and advance toward the eternal corridor together. If my plan succeeds, nothing will be beyond our reach. As the initiator of this plan, why can't we benefit the most from it? Don't forget that the enemy plane has three beings above the Yama-King level. Our Cathayan Underworld can take care of one on our own, but what can you do?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before they had a chance to say anything, Qin Ye continued, \"Also, this plan isn't just beneficial for our Cathayan Underworld. Firstly, this plan must be jointly announced by our four pillars for it to have sufficient impact. In other words, the influence of the four of us will be elevated to the max within our respective religions! If we manage to break through the shackles and advance into space, a lengthy era of colonization will follow. Do you want more ruler death gods to appear in the future to potentially undermine our positions in our respective religions? As we colonize more and more planes and get further and further away from Earth, that will inevitably happen, but as long as we can maintain our influence, there's no way anyone would be able to outstrip us.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">For example, as more and more planes were conquered and Taoism was spread to other planes, unpredictable changes would undoubtedly arise. Some planes would worship one death god, while other planes would worship another. This was very normal. It was just like how in Buddhism, some people believed in the Boddhisattva, some worshiped the Tathāgata, and some revered the Maitreya-nātha.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was controllable on Earth due to its limited size, but what about in space?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only by ensuring that they would remain as the sole paramount deity of their respective religions could they ensure that they wouldn't be replaced. Otherwise, they would follow the same fate as Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After 10 more minutes of silence, Yamaraja said, \"This is an extremely important matter, so I need time to think about it. I'll be returning to the Mahabodhi Temple right away, and I'll give you an answer in half a month. Also, what are we going to do with Usonia? There's no way that mad couple in Usonia would be willing to speak to us like this, and there's no one on the new continent capable of overtaking them. During the attack of the canter underworld, they're going to be a volatile factor.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In response to this concern, a faint smile appeared on Qin Ye's face as he said, \"How about you leave that to me? I'll go convince those two, and I'm 90% confident that I'll be successful in that endeavor. This will also be a gesture of good faith from me.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The other three ruler death gods exchanged a glance before accepting this arrangement and rising to their feet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Rest assured, we all understand the significance of this proposal, and we'll be sure to consider it carefully.\"</span></p>"

If all of the underworlds fought on their own, then there was no way that they'd be able to oppose the canter underworld.

No one was of the opinion that this could've been a joke or a prank. The subject matter was simply too serious for jokes to be made here, and the ruler death gods of the four pillars certainly weren't so bored that they would join forces just to prank the entire underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What if they were to agree?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the underworlds would receive rapid development, as well as shared resources, skilled personnel, and technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of those patents and pieces of technology that they had been eyeing with envy in the past, including even forbidden arts, would be shared with them!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that in mind, it seemed that this arrangement suddenly wasn't so difficult to accept.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The only thing that was preventing them from agreeing right away was the feeling of indignation from being forced into this arrangement, even though they knew the most of them wouldn't have been willing to accept this if the meeting had been arranged on an amicable basis.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hela took a deep breath, then gritted her teeth as she asked, \"What if the ruler death god of one of the alliances has had a major conflict with a member of their alliance in the past?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She was naturally referring to the five Northern Europa nations.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Back when their confrontation with the Argosian Underworld had reached its most severe point, the Argosian Underworld had already begun constructing forbidden arts on their coastline.

The fact that this question was being raised at all was already a sign that they were willing to accept this arrangement, and at this point, they were merely negotiating terms.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A faint smile appeared on Yamaraja's face. It made sense that the other death gods would be willing to accept this arrangement. They had already been forced into corners, so they had no choice but to accept.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were tempting all of the death gods with hefty benefits, but they were also willing to enforce this plan through violence. Prior to coming here, they had already mentally prepared themselves to destroy a few civilizations should that have been required.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Unbeknownst to everyone, the armies of the Argosian Underworld, the Aegyptian Underworld, and the Hindustani Underworld had already traveled to the Strait of Tsushima and the Mediterranean Sea. The Golden Fleet and the Naga Fleet could be deployed at any time, and any resistance from the death gods present would be quelled through devastating means!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, with the four pillars united, no one in the underworld would've been capable of opposing them anyway. The Alkebulan Underworlds were most likely going to remain neutral, while the new continent also seemed to have approved of this plan, so if a war really were to erupt, then the outcome of that war would've been all but decided from the very beginning.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The four pillars will sign Heavenly Dao Contracts with all of the underworlds joining the eight alliances,\" Qin Ye assured. \"There's no need to worry about prior conflicts. As long as you're in the eight alliances, you'll be our allies with whom we'll oppose the canter underworld together. There's no way that we'll do something to whittle down our own power.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The four pillars are willing to sign Heavenly Dao Contracts with us?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the ruler death gods were truly reassured upon hearing this. Heavenly Dao Contracts were agreements of the highest caliber in this plane, and the fact that they were being offered was a sign of the four pillars' determination.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"In that case, a clause must be included, stating that after the conclusion of the interplanar war, the eight alliances will be dissolved, and all of the underworlds will return to their original positions,\" a death god requested.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the ruler death gods had fallen into silent contemplation, thinking about what else they could negotiate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye swept his gaze around the entire venue, then said, \"Everyone, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. Challenges and opportunities have always come hand in hand. Regardless of whether you choose to join or not, the outcome will not change. The eight alliances will still be formed, and those who refuse to join it will cease to exist. The space exploration era is a brand new beginning. In that new era, any underworld could have a chance of experiencing a meteoric rise. On top of that, in the initial phase of that era, the four pillars won't impose any restrictions. All underworlds will set off in completely different directions, and even setting off earlier or later by a single day could yield completely different outcomes. It's time to make your decisions, everyone. We'll need to discuss the specific details together, but the decision must be made now.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone continued to remain silent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">15 minutes of silence quickly passed by. Only after close to half an hour had passed did Mythic Spirit Black Mamba finally rise to his feet, then took a deep breath as he declared in a solemn voice, \"I am willing to join the Mythic Spirit Alliance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right as his voice trailed off, a string of voices rang out at almost the exact same time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I am also willing to join the Mythic Spirit Alliance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"As am I.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Count me in too.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the ruler death gods turned around with surprised expressions to find that all of the Mythic Spirits of the Alkebulan Underworlds had risen to their feet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Mythic Spirit Black Mamba, Mythic Spirit Golden Rhinoceros, Mythic Spirit Emerald Hummingbird, Mythic Spirit Phoenix... All of the dozens of Mythic Spirits of the Alkebulan Underworlds had stood up at once, and it was as if the entire world had agreed!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Alkebulan Underworlds' Mythic Spirits were definitely not the most powerful of death gods. Due to the fact that they had been artificially raised to this level by the Plumed Serpent God, there was no way that they would ever go beyond the initial Yama-King level. Even during international conferences, they only held a single vote between them, but the one thing that they had in their favor was numbers!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They had dozens of tribes, represented by dozens of Mythic Spirits, and they had all stood up! Even though all of the other ruler death gods knew that the Mythic Spirits only held a single vote, this was still an astonishing sight!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Alkebulan Underworlds had chosen to cooperate. The entirety of Eastern Asia was under the Cathayan Underworld's control, while the Hindustani Underworld controlled the Strait of Tsushima and the Maluku Islands. The Middle East was the Aegyptian Underworld's territory, and then came the Argosian Underworld... Out of all of the land in the entire underworld, they took up over 50%!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Anko's fingernails were digging tightly into her palms, and just now, she had almost been swept up by the trend and also agreed to join the eight alliances. However, she was unable to bring herself to do so in the end.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As a ruler death god, she had her own divine nation! Why should she allow herself to be led by others?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thank you for your understanding.\" Qin Ye nodded in Thanatos's direction, and the latter's fingers moved slightly, upon which the array of death beside the Alkebulan Underworlds' Mythic Spirits silently vanished. The Mythic Spirits exchanged a few glances with one another, then vanished on the spot as bursts of Yin energy. By the time they reappeared, they had already appeared on the main stage, and they sat down in silence onto the dozens of seats that had already been prepared on the stage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Our patience is limited, everyone,\" Qin Ye said as a cold look appeared on his face. \"There are only 100 years before the commencement of the interplanar war. Also, let me reveal one more thing to all of you: the Cathayan Underworld wasn't the first one to discover the interplanar threat. Instead, it was the new continent.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A string of gasps instantly rang out in response, but he ignored everyone's stunned reactions as he continued, \"In order to survive, Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa turned to space. They were the first ones to develop an astronomical super-telescope, and it was also them who discovered the interplanar threat first. They stand with us... Do you understand?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"We can give you a final half-hour to make your decision,\" Anubis said as he also rose to his feet. \"I respect all cultures, civilizations, and underworlds, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to tolerate division and lack of cooperation even as the entire underworld is on the cusp of destruction!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yamaraja and Thanatos also stood up in unison, and even though they weren't saying anything, the Yin energy of four advanced Yama-Kings was as vast as the sea, crashing into every single corner of the conference hall, urging everyone to make their decisions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The souls of the Prefect-level and Judge-level ruler death gods present were being compressed under the immense pressure, and everyone felt as if there were a massive mountain weighing down directly upon them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if the sound of a ticking countdown timer could be heard, and finally, after another 10 minutes, Hela stood up with gritted teeth. At the same time, she was joined by Jörmungandr and Fenrir.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hela opened her mouth. Due to the fact that she was attending an international conference, she had made sure to put on her most splendid makeup. Her lips were gleaming as if they had been dipped in diamond powder, but after opening and closing her mouth several times in succession, she was still unable to say anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a few seconds, Jörmungandr decided to speak up in her stead, setting down all of his pride as he declared, \"The five nations of Northern Europa have decided to join the Europa Alliance. I hope you won't make us regret our decision in the future.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Europa Alliance welcomes you all,\" Thanatos said with a smile. \"Trust me, you definitely won't regret this decision. From now on, all of the past differences between the Argosian Underworld and the five Northern Europa underworlds will be seen as bygones.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Northern Europa death gods nodded in response, then vanished on the spot before appearing on the main stage.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus far, two underworlds had agreed to join the alliances, and both were significant powerhouses. Their departure seemed to have sent a signal to all of the other death gods, and soon, a figure clad in a black cloak also rose to his feet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was the nameless god of death!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone's attention was immediately drawn to him. He was the ruler death god of a first-rate underworld, one that controlled close to 10% of all of the entire underworld's landmass! What was his decision going to be?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Russian Underworld will join the Northern Alliance.\" The nameless god of death extended a slight bow toward the main stage as he spoke, and the array of death around him instantly faded.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the remaining death gods heaved a collective forlorn sigh upon seeing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thus far, around 90% of all of the world's territory had chosen to join the alliance, so there really was no point for them to hold out any longer.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Red Moon Federation will join the Southern Alliance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Star Cluster Alliance will join the Southern Alliance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Lithuanian Underworld will join the Europa Alliance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The Celtic Underworld will join the Northern Alliance.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the blink of an eye, one figure after another rose to their feet, and more and more figures were gathering on the main stage!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the span of less than 10 minutes, all of the ruler death gods had made their decisions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No matter how reluctant some of them were, all of the underworlds of the plane had finally been united as one.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ruler death gods of the four pillars turned toward the death gods seated behind them, then extended a bow together.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Thank you for your understanding, everyone.

The floor was so clean and bright that it could virtually double as a mirror, and directly above it was a dome roof with intricate reliefs engraved onto it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The corridor was lined with rows of soldiers clad in full suits of silver armor, wielding spears and swords in a menacing display like rows of statues. Right between the rows of soldiers, Catherine the Great was quickly rushing along the corridor of the hem of her dress in her hands.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her face was rather thin, and her serious expression was causing her nasolabial folds to be slightly elongated. With her reddish-brown hair and her lavish attire, she was like a noblewoman attending a funeral.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The truth wasn't far from that.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The underworld emissaries following along behind her didn't even dare to breathe too loudly, and as she opened a wooden door at the end of the corridor, all of the underworld emissaries inside immediately stood up straight, turning toward this unexpected guest with surprised expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What? You thought I wouldn't know just because I wasn't notified?\" Catherine quickly strode over to the round wooden table in the room, and the official who was seated there immediately vacated his seat for her. She was in no mood for any pleasantries, not even bothering to nod in acknowledgment of the official's gesture. Instead, she took a deep breath and pressed her palms down flat against the surface of the table, sweeping a sharp gaze around the entire room.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a luxurious hall with a resplendent crystal chandelier overhead. At this moment, the chandelier had been entirely lit up, making it resemble a galaxy of golden stars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were all types of statues placed around the area, as well as oil paintings hanging from the walls. All of the furniture, including the fireplace and the chairs, had gold-plated edges, and it was a scene so lavish that it seemed to belong only in medieval Europa films.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Peter the Great will be here soon.\" A cup of black tea was carefully placed in front of her, but she didn't even take a single glance at it as she said, \"Before he gets here, I want to know something: how long has it been since the nameless god of death was last here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one offered a response.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Do you still think you can hide this from me?!\" She slammed a hand viciously down onto the table. \"Maybe you can fool your own subordinates, but don't forget that I'm a death god! I can immediately sense it when the nameless god of death is absent! You've stopped me on more than one occasion from seeing the nameless god of death! Do you think I'm here to seize the throne?! You're all fools! The core of each underworld is its ruler death god. They are the only ones capable of using their underworld's creation-grade divine artifacts! Even if I do seize the throne, I'll just be kicked off again!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Catherine and Peter were the only ones who would dare to mention seizing the throne in this conference hall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An official with a coarse, white beard heaved a faint sigh, then said, \"It's already been two months.

Only after a long while did a portly official ask in a low voice, \"What do you think?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The answer had already occurred to everyone, but no one dared to articulate it because it seemed way too far-fetched.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Catherine had no such qualms.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"He's been abducted!\" Catherine said with a fierce gaze. \"For some reason, all of the underworld's ruler death gods have been abducted by someone in Formosa. We have to resolve this problem as quickly as possible! General Menshchikov, please rally up our troops right away. Also, send a message to the Cathayan Underworld demanding the return of our ruler death god!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">General Menshchikov was a thin middle-aged man with an impeccably groomed mustache. Upon hearing Catherine's instructions, a wry smile appeared on his face as he replied, \"I already thought about doing that 10 days ago, but I did some research, and it turns out that the Cathayan Underworld's new super weapon, Death God, hasn't been included into the treaty on the non-proliferation of forbidden arts.

The middle-aged man immediately extended a relieved bow, then said, \"We are receiving a video conference request from the venue where the conference in Formosa is being held, and the conference is being hosted by the ruler death gods of the four pillars!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This very same piece of news was received by all of the underworlds.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the Red Moon Federation, a minister was staring at the secretary standing before him with a surprised expression. \"The four pillars sent out a video conference request from Formosa?

Thus, all of the underworlds have come together to make an important decision. The agreements have already been signed in the form of Heavenly Dao Contracts, and all of the ruler death god present have the original copies of the agreements. I hereby declare the official implementation of the Genesis plan. From this day forth, there will be no more national borders and no more visas!

Before we secure the ultimate victory, all that will remain in this world will be the eight alliances, which are the the Asian Alliance, the Southern Alliance, the Middle Eastern Alliance, the Europa Alliance, the Northern Alliance, the Mythic Spirit Alliance, the Southern New Continent Alliance, and the Northern New Continent Alliance. No underworlds will exist in these alliances, and all existing governments will be immediately abolished.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of the underworld emissaries watching in front of their screens stood up in unison in astonishment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"How is this possible?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Who proposed this?!

Everyone's attention was focused on the lectern, and Qin Ye suddenly smiled before continuing, \"Prior to reading out the document, everyone here has a right to know the circumstances surrounding this invasion.

Are you trying to transform the Cathayan Underworld into a fascist nation? The Nipponese Underworld has existed for close to 2,000 years!

Throughout all of history, all underworlds have followed the same process of formation. A nation has to be united, following which a religion arises, and only then can death gods and underworlds emerge. Thus, the Nipponese Underworld has always been part of the Cathayan Underworld's territory! As such, the war between the Cathayan Underworld and the Nipponese Underworld is an internal affair of&nbsp;the Cathayan Underworld, and all underworlds that dare to intervene in this matter will be viewed as the Cathayan Underworld's enemy!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His voice was like rumbling thunder that rang out across the entire conference hall, but no one said anything on this occasion.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There was too much information to process...</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The fall of the Nipponese Underworld was already a foregone conclusion, but what was much more astonishing to everyone was the knowledge of what had happened in the Cathayan Underworld during the past century.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was no wonder that the Cathayan Underworld had isolated itself from the rest of the world.

Following the emergence of the new energy resource, the five Northern Europa nations had even managed to grab some market share in the Argosian Underworld with its cutting-edge technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, it turned out that they had been relying on a sinking ship all along!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Cathayan Underworld had the new energy resource and Zhao Yun, but all of the other three pillars had a crushing advantage over the Cathayan Underworld regardless of whether it came to wealth or power!

So long as the Array of the Nine Gods remained standing, there was no way that anyone would've been able to find out the true state of the Cathayan Underworld, so why had he willingly revealed this information?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thanatos was looking up at Qin Ye with a perplexed expression, unable to comprehend Qin Ye's words and actions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye seemed to be able to see the thoughts of all of the death gods, and he smiled as he suddenly said, \"As I'm sure you're all aware, the current capital city of the Cathayan Underworld is Everburn. You may be under the impression that we simply renamed Fengdu, but that is not the case. All of the old Hell's resources, cities, and Yin spirits were eradicated during Ksitigarbha's ascension, so the new Hell was built up completely from scratch. At the moment, our population only stands at around 300 to 400 million, while the troops in our army only number in the millions.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The commotion in the hall crescendoed to even greater heights in the wake of this revelation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even Hela, Jörmungandr, and all of the Alkebulan Mythical Spirits had risen to their feet.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What is he doing?!

She had thought that she would receive special treatment due to the fact that the five Northern Europa nations were close allies with the Cathayan Underworld, but that was not the case. \"You are provoking the order of the entire world!

On the contrary, we decided to hold this conference precisely on the basis of humanitarian considerations.\" Qin Ye's expression remained unchanged, and he made a grabbing motion, upon which a series of contracts flew into the hands of all of the ruler death gods present. \"I hope you'll all change your minds once you read through these contracts.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pillars of golden light had formed a cage around the entire venue, and the ruler death gods didn't dare to resist.

However, one could clearly sense that the atmosphere had become incredibly tense, and the only sound that could be heard in the hall was the flipping of pages.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only after a full half-hour had passed did all of the death gods raise their heads, and their anger had already abated significantly, but they were still feeling rather indignant. \"Is this why the ruler death gods of the four pillars have imprisoned us here?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"No,\" Qin Ye replied in a calm voice. \"This is not the reason.

That includes forbidden arts.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone drew a sharp breath upon hearing this.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Theoretically speaking, they should've been extremely excited to hear that forbidden arts technology was going to be made available to everyone, but no one was feeling excited at this moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The fact that the four pillars were comfortable with releasing forbidden arts technology to the entire underworld meant that they were confident that the rest of the world wouldn't be able to overtake them, even if everyone had access to forbidden arts, and that was definitely not good news to the nations outside of the four pillars.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"The specific clauses will be released to everyone later, including a list of all of the patents and technologies that will be made publicly available, as well as locations where centralized training will be conducted. The second clause is that in three months, the four pillars will implement an international no borders plan. Borders no longer need to exist between nations! All Yin spirits can go to any underworld to work and join the military.

The ruler death gods of the three pillars also wore solemn expressions, and Thanatos was already prepared to activate the Pandora Array of Death at any moment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They were all aware of the fact that the first two clauses were only setting up for the third clause.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Three seconds of silence came next, during which all of the ruler death gods involuntarily sat up straighter.

All underworlds will be declared defunct, and all nations must become part of one of the eight alliances! The eight alliances are the Asian Alliance, the Southern Alliance, the Middle Eastern Alliance, the Europa Alliance, the Northern Alliance, the Mythic Spirit Alliance, the Southern New Continent Alliance, and the Northern New Continent Alliance!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before he had even finished, the entire venue had already erupted into a frenzy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All underworlds were going to be abolished, replaced by the eight alliances!

The Asian Alliance will be overseen by the Cathayan Underworld. The Southern Alliance will be overseen by the Red Moon Federation. The Middle Eastern Alliance will be overseen by the Aegyptian Underworld. The Europa Alliance, which includes the five Northern Europa nations, will be overseen by the Argosian Underworld. The Northern Alliance, which includes the Celtic Underworld and the Russian Underworld, will be overseen by the Russian Underworld. The Mythic Spirit Alliance will be overseen by a chieftain selected by the Alkebulan Underworlds' Mythic Spirits. The breaking-in period for this change could take five years, 10 years, or even 20 years, but it must be done!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">To his surprise, none of the ruler death gods said anything. Instead, they began to listen carefully.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye was quite encouraged by this, and he continued, \"Over 20 military bases and sanctuaries are to be constructed in each of the alliances. Also, resources, information, and skilled personnel will all be shared in the eight alliances! These alliances will exist until we secure victory in the interplanar war. Any questions?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was far too astonishing a revelation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one could've anticipated that the four pillars would be so determined as to abolish all underworlds to arrange them into alliances.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">They also finally understood why the Pandora Array of Death had been set up here. There was no way that everyone would agree to this arrangement unless their lives were under threat, as was the case right now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"I have a question.\" As soon as Qin Ye's voice trailed off, Anko rose to her feet before asking, \"What is the purpose of these alliances? Why do they need to exist?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Qin Ye nodded in response. \"Perhaps you're still all unaware of this, but the Cathayan Underworld and the new continent have already developed astronomical super-telescopes. The remains of Yama-King level beings must be used as a foundation for this type of telescopes, and through our observation of space using these telescopes, we discovered signs of the nine stars beginning to align. We are separated from the canter underworld by four or&nbsp;five planes, and the canter underworld has a lead of at least 300 years over us when it comes to space exploration technology. They possess sufficient power to transform those planes into military bases, so when the planar walls open up, the first battle that we have to face will be one to protect our plane. I don't care what size your underworld is or how much power it possesses, if it's conquered by the enemy, then that'll become their first foothold on our plane, and we definitely don't want to see that happen! However, do you think you'll all be capable of defending your underworlds? Only the four pillars can directly oppose the enemy plane. If we don't unite as one and share all of our resources, we won't be able to save you! This is not a joke, everyone! In the face of the enemy's forces, your underworlds most likely won't be able to last even a week! Once your underworld is conquered, they'll be able to set up interplanar teleportation arrays on our plane to forcibly invade.

Only by uniting everyone and drawing upon everyone's resources will we be able to overcome our opponents, who have a 500-year space exploration lead over us. We can't allow there to be too many voices. If you won't silence them, then I'll do it.

He can be extremely patient, but when he does strike, he always makes it count, and he treats the Cathayan Underworld's allied nations quite well. However, he hasn't even given us any advance warning on this occasion, so there must be something extremely significant afoot.

However, not even the Cathayan Underworld's closest allies, including the Alkebulan Underworlds and the five Northern Europa nations, knew anything.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, the chime of a bell rang out, signifying the official commencement of the conference. All of the ruler death gods quickly entered the newly built conference hall on the island of Formosa.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The conference hall was extremely tall and spacious. During meetings between ruler death gods, the rulers of the four pillars were always situated at the front of the venue. After all of the death gods entered the hall, Anko took a glance up ahead to find that the ruler death gods of the four pillars were absent, upon which she raised an eyebrow in befuddlement.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why aren't they here?

Why has it appeared here?!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A string of questions instantly sprang into her mind.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Why weren't the ruler death gods of the four pillars here? Why had they chosen to gather all of the underworld's ruler death gods here?

All of the panicked death gods had only just risen to their feet, and they immediately turned toward the direction that the voice had come from.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The ruler death gods of the four pillars had appeared on the stage, and they were led by none other than Qin Ye. He seemed to be unable to see the array as he sat down calmly, then nodded toward all of the death gods. \"Greetings, everyone. I am the ruler death god of the Cathayan Underworld, Yanluo Qin.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"What is the meaning of this?!\" Several ruler death gods immediately turned to him with enraged expressions.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Are you trying to take over the whole world?!

The ruler death gods of the four pillars had released their Yin energy in unison, and their advanced Yama-King level auras encompassed the entire hall, instantly reducing it to silence.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You're overthinking things, everyone.\" Qin Ye was the one who had set all of this into motion, so it was only right that he played the bad guy here. \"This world is spectacular precisely because of the existence of all of these cultures and civilizations.

This is something that only the ruler death gods of the four pillars have ever been aware of.\"</span></p>"

All of the scholars and skilled personnel across the world were also taking part in the projects, working on solutions to all of the difficult issues that could potentially arise along the way. The Cathayan Underworld and the new continent had also made all of their space exploration knowledge publicly available, and Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa returned to their posts as rulers of the new continent.

Death Goddess Catherine had arrived in Antarctica in person to establish the defensive arrays and set up all of the defensive infrastructure, all of which referenced the most advanced blueprints that the four pillars had to offer.

With all of these massive projects going on at once, the netherworldly citizens of the underworld naturally had to make a contribution.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The times were rapidly changing, and there was no option other than to adapt with the ever-changing situation.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At a time like this, the entire world had to come together in a single, unified front as any internal conflict would lead to certain destruction.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The underworld had never been so harmonious and cohesive.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A week later, the Cathayan Underworld officially announced the opening of the nation and the withdrawal of the Array of the Nine Gods. In the blink of an eye, investments from the top 10 consortiums and all of the major corporations across the world came flying in. It was also on this day that all of the Cathayan Underworld's 180 coastal ports, including the ones in the province of Nippon, were divided up into eight clusters of ports, and countless merchant ships traveling to Asia quickly flocked to those ports.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A year later, the top 10 consortiums and some of the wealthiest individuals announced the establishment of the Starfire Trust Fund, which offered low-interest loans to all military base construction projects across the world. At the same time, the top 10 consortiums announced that they would construct a military base in the Greenland Underworld, as well as participate fully in the space fortress development project.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Three years later, worldwide conscription commenced, and countless Yin spirits answered the call, thereby significantly strengthening the world's military forces.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time passed by one year after another, and the entire underworld was steadily preparing for the upcoming war. Countless conferences were being held every single day, and huge numbers of new weapons were being released each year. With the entire world working together, many difficult problems in the field of Yin runology that had stumped all researchers in the past had been overcome.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 38th year of the third coming of Hell, Vice-president Li Chun of the Sword Coral Research Institute restored the siege weapon, the City Vanquishing Crossbow, and made improvements upon it.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 42nd year of the third coming of Hell, President Lu Ban of the Yin Mountains Research Institute developed a brand new siege weapon, the Sunstrike Carriage, using the polymerization effect of Yin runes in the ninth circle, and its power is comparable with that of missiles of the mortal realm.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During that same year, President Aristotle of the Argosian Underworld's round table used Yin runes in the ninth circle to develop a brand new defensive array, which was named Styx. The power of Styx is around 20% of that of the Array of the Nine Gods, and a joint decision was made by all of the leaders of the eight alliances to send out all death gods aside from ruler death gods to begin establishing Styx arrays on the planar wall right beneath Limbo.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The vast project was named the Heavenly Wall project, and it was estimated to take as long as 60 years to complete. However, not a single death god refused to accept the task.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Initially, everyone had been quite disgruntled by the abrupt stripping of their jurisdictive power, but the power of their nations was growing by the day with the influx of all types of knowledge, resources, and technologies from other nations. As a result, they had already cast aside their discontent.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In any case, there was no going back, so what was the point in fighting against the inevitable?</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 43rd year of the third coming of Hell, Archimedes and the round table joined the presidents of the Cathayan Underworld's top two state-run research institutes to hold a five-year-long Yin runology seminar, during which they taught the entire world everything they knew. The seminar became a grand event of the scientific world that was later dubbed the World Technology Advancement Summit.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 51st year of the third coming of Hell, the Celtic Underworld became the last underworld to successfully perform a Death God detonation.

The 10 years after that were projected to be the beginning of the information, and internet technology disseminated across the world as quickly as possible.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, the mortal realm had already developed 10G and was on the cusp of achieving brain-controlled technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The G was a unit of data flow rate, and the incredible thing about 5G wasn't how fast its download speed was. Instead, what was remarkable was the degree of human-computer interaction that could be reached under a 5G environment.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">An example of this was voice-controlled cars.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Back in 2020, this was nothing more than a distant dream, but by 2025, when 5G had become available to the entire world, researchers were able to tap into the potential for this type of technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Another example was hologram technology, which was commonly deployed in gaming chambers and gaming helmets. The technology had been successfully developed during the 7G age in the mortal realm, and it had already become prevalent by the 8G age, but in the same time period, the underworld had only just developed internet technology.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the past, suitable routes and materials had proven very difficult to find, and Yin energy had severely hampered the transmission of internet signals. However, this year, Bill Gates, who had already entered the underworld at this point, made another breakthrough, producing internet technology that was both cheap and practical after over 10 years of development.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 61st year of the third coming of Hell, an Underworld Wide Web was constructed, and interactions between the mortal realm and the underworld reached a peak.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">During the same year, the top 10 consortiums founded the Blue Star Corporation, which included the majority of network engineers, thereby forcibly seizing this lucrative sector from the jaws of the eight alliances.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With extremely alluring salaries and benefits on offer, the consortiums and wealthy individuals of the world were able to make their wealth talk. Hiring advertisements for the Blue Star Corporation were being broadcast day and night. So long as one could move, there was always a job that they could do in the Blue Star Corporation!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What was all of this manpower required for? It was for laying down networks and constructing base stations! Manpower was required for everything! There was a period of time where Qin Ye was even hoping that some major natural disasters would occur in the mortal realm to claim more lives, thereby providing the underworld with more labor resources.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That same year, the total number of Death God weapons in the world reached 43, including those in the world's gate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 60th year of the third coming of Hell, the entire underworld entered the information age. Even though the underworld was still lagging far behind the mortal realm, they needed time to digest this new technology. The mortal realm had already reached 11G, while the underworld had also reached 8G.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 61st year of the third coming of Hell, the Cathayan Underworld successfully launched the first planar satellite by the name of Kuafu. The satellite orbited the underworld in the gap between the underworld and Limbo, and it was entirely constructed from the S-grade material, Fusang Wood. The entire satellite was engraved with special Yin runes from the 10th circle, and it brought satellite images of the plane to all of the underworld's netherworldly citizens for the first time.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The following year, the four pillars launched several more planar satellites.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Two years later, all of the eight alliances had launched planar satellites of their own.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Five years later, a total of 23 planar satellites were orbiting the underworld.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire underworld was constantly and comprehensively displayed to all of the netherworldly citizens without any blind spots.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A special website by the name of Heavenly Eye was set up to complement these satellites by the eight alliances. Images of all parts of the underworld could be viewed at any time of the day, and this would ensure that the eight alliances would be able to constantly monitor every part of the world once the interplanar war commenced.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 68th year of the third coming of Hell, the Cathayan Underworld's Jade Rabbit was launched during a worldwide live stream, and the entire underworld celebrated the historic event.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was a monumental moment that told everyone that they were capable of retaliation in the upcoming interplanar war. Furthermore, the front line was going to be moved out of the plane, so the underworld wouldn't be ravaged by the war!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, the Jade Rabbit alone wasn't enough.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A month later, the new continent's Tecutli and Tikasiwa were launched at once, and excitement and anticipation for the upcoming war reached a peak as a result.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A week later, the Starfire Trust Fund established the Airspace Corporation, which specialized in constructing space shuttles to be enclosed in space fortresses.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That same year, the total number of Death God weapons in the underworld reached 53, including those in the world's gate.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">New Hell's Legacy: During the 91st year of the third coming of Hell, abnormal phenomena were already beginning to take place in the world. Countless cloud vortexes had appeared in the sky, but there was nothing inside them. Even normal netherworldly citizens could sense a burst of unprecedentedly formidable Yin energy approaching from outside of the plane, and it was already very close.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Also during that same year, the armies of the eight alliances finally gathered in the Australis Underworld after 60 years of development.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The massive army filled the entire surface of the sea.

At the time, he had been so frightened by Dong Zhuo's forces that he had fled all the way to the City of Salvation, where he underwent an evolution.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There, he had met the Harken, and thus began his journey to rebuild Hell. It was also there that he had met Cao Youdao. So many things had happened there, and so many people had been encountered there.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At the City of Salvation, he became an Anitya Hellguard and attacked Reflection Palace.

Of course, we could understand her decision. At the time, Hell was going to require a very long time to develop, so it made sense that she would choose someone who had consumed this Taisui fungus. However, what we failed to anticipate was that Hell would rise from the ashes again so soon. To think that in less than 100 years, you've already risen to a position where you're leading the world's army to this place.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"You may not be the founder of the Cathayan Underworld, but having recovered Mongolia and conquered the Nipponese Underworld, your achievements are no lesser than those of the first King Yanluo,\" Mencius chimed in. \"It's all thanks to your efforts that the Cathayan Underworld was able to continue its heritage and complete its resurgence.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The second King Yanluo gently cleared his throat in protest, but the three saints didn't even take a single glance at him. \"Now then, are you prepared for the final battle, Yanluo Qin?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they could overcome this hurdle, then they would be stepping into a brand new chapter of space exploration.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If they couldn't overcome this obstacle, then the underworld would fall, and they would be eternally enslaved.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\"Of course,\" Qin Ye said as a serious look appeared on his face. \"I came here for the sole purpose of joining this war!

It started from Qin Ye's conversation with Mictlantecutli and Mictetikasiwa on the new continent, followed by Qin Ye's observation into space through the Omeyocan plan's super astronomical telescope, then discussed the remains of the extraterrestrial death god and how it had ended up on Earth.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After that, the Cathayan Underworld's space exploration plan was detailed, followed by the black boxes kept by the four pillars...&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As Qin Ye's voice grew louder and louder, the accompanying background music also grew louder in volume, and half an hour later, Qin Ye declared amid a chorus of rousing music, \"Everyone, we are far from powerless to resist!

There were countless patrolling soldiers, as well as innumerable warships berthed at the ports. The Yin energy above the world's gate was so dense that it was like a substantial cloud, and this was an extremely rousing image for all beholders.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the power of Earth!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Finally, the image settled onto the inky-black world's gate, which was several dozen meters tall with the head of a lion engraved upon it. At the same time, a line of red text appeared on the screen: \"We are now recruiting soldiers from all over the world.

He had heard from many people and seen through many movies that adrenaline and instincts were the things that fueled one on a battlefield, so courage was irrelevant, but just the mere thought of having to rush into battle against enemy soldiers was something that he didn't think that he would ever be able to do.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, that didn't mean that he couldn't contribute to this war!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A determined look appeared in his eyes as he gritted his teeth tightly.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if I can't go into battle myself, I'll make sure to support our forces in any way that I can!

All of the Yin spirits on the entire plaza... In fact, all of the Yin spirits in the entire nation had faltered in unison.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was because they had just heard a very clear cracking sound.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was as if a panel of glass had just been broken right next to them.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Countless Yin spirits looked up at the heavens.
